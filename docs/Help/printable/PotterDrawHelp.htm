<h1>Getting Started</h1>
<a name="Introduction"><h2>Introduction</h2></a>

<p>PotterDraw is a free 3D software application for designing and visualizing pottery. It's useful for creating cylindrical shapes such as pots, flasks, vases, bowls, plates, cups, glasses, goblets, or anything similar. The outer wall of the pot is drawn using a <a href="#Spline">spline</a>, which consists of one or more curved or linear segments. The inner wall is generated automatically.

<p>PotterDraw can <a href="#Export">export</a> files suitable for 3D printing. It can also map <a href="#Texture_synthesis">synthesized</a> or user-specified textures onto the pot. Mesh and texture <a href="#Properties">properties</a> can be <a href="#Modulation">modulated</a> by oscillators for more complex effects, and the modulations can be <a href="#Animation">animated</a> to create <a href="#Record">videos</a>.

<a name="Requirements"><h2>Requirements</h2></a>

<p>Recommended:

<p>Windows 7 or higher, 64-bit
<br>4GB memory or more
<br>Quad-core CPU
<br>Decent graphics card

<a name="Installing"><h2>Installing</h2></a>

<p>PotterDraw comes in two flavors (Installer and Portable), each of which is available in both 64-bit and 32-bit versions. If you have a 64-bit CPU, it's strongly recommended to use the 64-bit version of PotterDraw. Most users want an installer, because it's easier. For example, installing adds PotterDraw to the Windows start menu, and allows PotterDraw to register its file types, so that they have appropriate icons and can be opened via double-clicking in Explorer.

<p><b>Installing for the first time:</b>

<p>Make sure you're logged on as Administrator. The Installer flavor of PotterDraw is distributed as a zip file. Unzip the distribution file, using WinZip or an equivalent program, and then double-click on PotterDraw.msi to launch the installer. The installer is about as simple as an installer can be: for the default setup, just keep hitting "Next." Note that on the "Select Installation Folder" page, you have the option to install for all users, but the default is to only install for the current user.

<p><b>Upgrading a previous installation:</b>

<ol>
<li>Make sure you're logged on as Administrator.
<li>Unzip the distribution file to a folder, if you haven't already.
<li>In that folder, double-click Upgrade.bat to launch the installer.
<li>In the installer, select the "Repair" option.
</ol>

<p>Note that double-clicking PotterDraw.msi won't work for upgrades: you will get the message "Another version of this product is already installed".

<p>To use the portable app, simply unzip the distribution file to a folder and double-click PotterDraw.exe to run the application.

<a name="Uninstalling"><h2>Uninstalling</h2></a>

<p>To uninstall PotterDraw, use Add/Remove Programs in the Control Panel, or double-click on PotterDraw.msi and select the "Remove" option.

<p>To remove the portable version, delete the folder you unzipped the application files into, and also delete the following registry key:
<br>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Anal Software\PotterDraw

<a name="Getting_help"><h2>Getting help</h2></a>

<p>PotterDraw has context-sensitive help, which means that pressing <span class="key">F1</span> shows different topics depending on the situation. Context-sensitive help is available for the following types of user-interface objects:

<p><table border=1 cellpadding=2 cellspacing=0>
<tr><th>Object type</th><th>To get help:</th></tr>
<tr><td>Menus and context menus</td><td>Hover the cursor over a menu item and press <span class="key">F1</span>.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Toolbar buttons</td><td>Hover the cursor over a button and press <span class="key">F1</span>.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Property bars</td><td>Left-click a property name and press <span class="key">F1</span>.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Other toolbars</td><td>Left-click a control and press <span class="key">F1</span>.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Modal dialogs</td><td>Press <span class="key">F1</span> while the dialog is displayed. For some dialogs, the topic shown depends on which control has focus.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>If none of the above cases apply, or if help is accessed via <a href="#Help_Topics">Help Topics</a>, a default topic is shown.


<h1>View</h1>

<a name="View"><h2>View</h2></a>

<p>PotterDraw's main view shows the pot in 3D. The view is read-only. To change the pot, edit its <a href="#Spline">spline</a> or other <a href="#Properties">properties</a>.

<p>To rotate the pot, left-click and drag the cursor while keeping the left mouse button pressed. The cursor affects pitch and yaw, i.e. rotation around the x and y axes. To roll, i.e. to rotate the pot around the z-axis, also press the <span class="key">Shift</span> key and drag the cursor horizontally.

<p>To zoom in or out, position the cursor at the desired location and spin the mouse wheel. The <span class="key">Ctrl+=</span> and <span class="key">Ctrl+-</span> shortcuts also work, and <span class="key">Ctrl+0</span> resets the zoom.

<p>To pan the view, press the middle mouse button and drag the cursor while keeping the middle mouse button pressed.

<p>The view supports various <a href="#Render_Styles">render styles</a>.

<p>By default PotterDraw uses tabbed MDI. If you prefer the classic non-tabbed MDI look, you can enable it via the <a href="#Tabs">Tabs</a> command.

<a name="Render_Styles"><h2>Render Styles</h2></a>

<p><table border=1 cellpadding=2 cellspacing=0>
<tr><th>Style</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr><td><a href="#Wireframe">Wireframe</a></td><td>Display the pot as a wireframe model.</td></tr>
<tr><td><a href="#Gouraud">Gouraud</a></td><td>Interpolate color within facets so that the pot's surface appears smooth.</td></tr>
<tr><td><a href="#Highlights">Highlights</a></td><td>Display specular highlights as if the pot were made of a shiny material.</td></tr>
<tr><td><a href="#Culling">Culling</a></td><td>Skip the rendering of completely hidden facets to improve performance.</td></tr>
<tr><td><a href="#Texture">Texture</a></td><td>Display the current <a href="#Texture_synthesis">synthesized</a> or <a href="#Texture_Path">user-specified</a> texture on the pot.</td></tr>
<tr><td><a href="#Animation">Animation</a></td><td>Animate any <a href="#Modulation">modulations</a> that have non-zero <a href="#Phase_Speed">phase speeds</a>.</td></tr>
<tr><td><a href="#Bounds">Bounds</a></td><td>Show an outlined bounding box around the pot.</td></tr>
</table>


<h1>Spline</h1>

<a name="Spline"><h2>Spline</h2></a>

<p>The spline lets you to draw the pot's outer wall using a series of curves or lines. The spline determines the radius of each of the pot's <a href="#Rings">rings</a>.

<a name="Segments_and_nodes"><h3>Segments and nodes</h3></a>

<p>The spline consists of one or more segments. Each segment can be a B&eacute;zier curve or a straight line. The segments join at <em>nodes</em>. When a segment is selected, its nodes are displayed as small hollow squares. A B&eacute;zier segment also has two <em>control points</em>, which can be moved to adjust the curve. The control points are displayed as small solid squares, connected to their corresponding nodes by lines called <em>curve vectors</em>. To change the shape of a B&eacute;zier segment, drag its control points and/or its nodes.

<p>There are three types of nodes. A node's type determines how the two curve vectors sharing that node are constrained.

<p><table border=1 cellpadding=2 cellspacing=0>
<tr><th>Node Type</th><th>Constraint</th></tr>
<tr><td>Cusp</td><td>No constraint; use this type to create a sharp corner between two adjacent curves.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Smooth</td><td>The two curve vectors meeting at the node are constrained to be co-linear and opposite.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Symmetrical</td><td>Similar to smooth, but the curve vectors are additionally constrained to be the same length.</td></tr>
</table>

<a name="Shape_limitations"><h3>Shape limitations</h3></a>

<p>For normal operation, the entire spline must be positive in X, i.e. it should be entirely to the right of the x-axis. If the spline crosses the x-axis, the resulting pot will have a discontinuous surface, and won't be 3D-printable.

<p>The spline should also continuously increase in the y-axis. Put another way, the spline should intersect any given y-coordinate no more than once. If this isn't so, PotterDraw will simplify the spline as needed.

<p>Note that only a subset of the possible B&eacute;zier curves can be faithfully translated into a 3D mesh. For example, curves that loop or cross themselves won't work properly. For each B&eacute;zier segment, if its lower control point is below its lower node, or its upper control point is above its upper node, the segment crosses a y-coordinate more than once and will be simplified.

<p>To check your spline's conformance with the above constraints, use the <a href="#Mesh_Information">Mesh Information</a> command.

<a name="Navigation_and_selection"><h3>Navigation and selection</h3></a>

<p>To zoom in or out, position the cursor at the desired location and spin the mouse wheel. The <span class="key">Ctrl+=</span> and <span class="key">Ctrl+-</span> shortcuts also work, and <span class="key">Ctrl+0</span> resets the zoom.

<p>To pan the spline window, press the middle mouse button and drag the cursor while keeping the middle mouse button pressed.

<p>To select a segment, left-click it. A range of segments can be selected, either by using Shift+left-click, or by drag selecting. To drag select, press the left mouse button and hold it down while dragging the cursor, moving the selection rectangle so that it intersects the desired segments; they will be selected when you release the left mouse button. To cancel a drag select, press Escape.

<p>To select all segments, use <span class="cmd">Edit/Select All</span> or <span class="key">Ctrl+A</span>. To deselect all segments, left-click in the spline window's background, i.e. somewhere not on the spline.

<a name="Changing_segment_and_node_types"><h3>Changing segment and node types</h3></a>

<p>To change a single segment's type, right-click the segment and select the desired type from the context menu. To change the type of multiple segments at once, first select the segments and then change their type via <span class="cmd">Spline/Segment Type</span> in the main menus, or by right-clicking somewhere not on the spline and using the context menu.

<p>Node type works similarly. To change a single node's type, right-click the node and select the desired type from the context menu. To change the type of multiple nodes at once, first select the segments and then change their node type via <span class="cmd">Spline/Node Type</span> in the main menus, or by right-clicking somewhere not on the spline and using the context menu.

<a name="Adding_and_removing_nodes"><h3>Adding and removing nodes</h3></a>

<p>To add a node, double-click where the node should go. To delete a node, double-click it. You can also add and delete nodes by right-clicking and using the context menu.

<p>Nodes can be added anywhere except on top of an existing node. If you add a node to a segment, the segment is divided into two segments. If you add a node somewhere else, a new segment is added between the nearest end of the spline and the cursor position.

<p>The spline must contain at least one segment, otherwise all the rings will have a radius of zero, resulting in an invisible pot.

<a name="Dragging_segments_and_nodes"><h3>Dragging segments and nodes</h3></a>

<p>To move a segment, left-click it anywhere but on its nodes, and drag it while holding down the left mouse button. To move a node or a control point, left-click it and drag it while holding down the left mouse button.

<p>Selected segments can also be moved by left-clicking one of the selected segments anywhere but on its nodes, and then dragging while holding down the left mouse button.

<a name="Editing_and_transformations"><h3>Editing and transformations</h3></a>

<p>Selected spline segments can be <a href="#Cut">cut</a>, <a href="#Copy">copied</a>, <a href="#Paste">pasted</a> and <a href="#Delete">deleted</a>, using the standard Windows editing commands, accessible via the main menu's Edit submenu. Selected spline segments can be also transformed in various ways. They can be <a href="#Translate">translated</a> (moved), <a href="#Scale">scaled</a>, <a href="#Rotate">rotated</a>, and flipped <a href="#Flip_Horizontal">horizontally</a> or <a href="#Flip_Vertical">vertically</a>. All of these transformations are accessible via the main menu's Spline submenu.

<p>Scaling can be proportional (isotropic) or non-proportional (anisotropic). Scaling and rotation can be relative to the origin, or relative to the center of the selected segments. Scaling relative to the origin is useful for changing the size of the entire pot without otherwise changing its geometry.

<a name="Grid_and_rulers"><h3>Grid and rulers</h3></a>

<p>The spline window can display a <a href="#Show_Grid">grid</a>, and the dragging of <a href="#Segments_and_nodes">segments and nodes</a> can be <a href="#Snap_to_Grid">snapped</a> to the grid. To change the grid spacing, use the <a href="#Grid_Setup">Grid Setup</a> command in the Spline submenu. The spline window can also display <a href="#Show_Rulers">rulers</a>. The <a href="#Opposite_Wall">opposite wall</a> of the shape can also be displayed. This is useful because the opposite wall is updated continuously during node or segment dragging, whereas the <a href="#View">view</a> is normally only updated when the dragging is completed (though this is <a href="#Show_Spline_Drag_in_View">configurable</a>).

<a name="Spline_import-export"><h3>Spline import/export</h3></a>

<p>Splines can be <a href="#Export_Spline">exported</a> or <a href="#Import_Spline">imported</a> as text files containing a series of 2D points which constitute the spline. This allows splines to be generated by or processed by an external program. The format of the spline text file is explained below. For an example, use the export command and then examine the resulting file.

<p>Each line of a spline text file must contain exactly one 2D point. The point's X and Y values must be separated by one or more tabs or spaces. The first point is the start point of the entire spline. Each subsequent group of three points describes a B&eacute;zier curve, specified by its first control point, its second control point, and its end point. After the first curve, each subsequent curve starts at the previous curve's end point. The total number of 2D points in the file must be a multiple of three, plus one for the start point.


<h1>Properties</h1>

<a name="Properties"><h2>Properties</h2></a>

<p>PotterDraw supports a list of properties which can be used to enhance the pot's appearance beyond its basic shape, which is determined by its <a href="#Spline">spline</a>. Properties can also be <a href="#Modulation">modulated</a> by oscillators for more complex effects. The properties are explained in detail in the topics below, and summarized <a href="#Properties_Summary">here</a>. They're grouped into the following categories:

<p><table border=1 cellpadding=2 cellspacing=0>
<tr><th>Group</th><th>Purpose</th></tr>
<tr><td>Mesh</td><td>Alterations to the pot's 3D mesh.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Texture</td><td>Alterations to the pot's 2D <a href="#Texture">texture</a>.</td></tr>
<tr><td>View</td><td><a href="#View">View</a>-related properties; also see <a href="#Render_Styles">Render Styles</a>.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>The properties bar displays the property values for the active document, and lets you edit them. To show the properties bar, use <span class="cmd">View/Toolbars and Docking Windows/Properties</span>. To edit a property, left-click its value. You can also navigate the list using the Up and Down arrows, and edit the selected property by pressing the <span class="key">Tab</span> key. Most properties are either numeric values or lists. The editing features of the different property types are explained below.

<p><table border=1 cellpadding=2 cellspacing=0>
<tr><th>Type</th><th>Usage</th></tr>
<tr><td>Numeric</td><td>Left-click the value to display an edit box; then type a new value, or edit the existing value, and press <span class="key">Enter</span> or <span class="key">Tab</span> to save your change.

<h2>Mesh</h2>

<a name="Rings"><h3>Rings</h3></a>

<p>The pot is constructed as a vertical stack of polygonal rings. This property sets the number of rings in the pot. It's a tradeoff between smoothness and performance: the more rings there are, the smoother the pot's surface is, but the longer it takes to render the pot. Too few rings gives the pot a jagged, faceted appearance; excessive values make the application sluggish. The default value of 100 is a reasonable starting point.

<p>The Rings and <a href="#Sides">Sides</a> properties together determine the total number of facets, which is approximately Rings &times; Sides &times; 4. The exact number can be displayed via <a href="#Mesh_Information">Mesh Information</a>.

<a name="Sides"><h3>Sides</h3></a>

<p>This sets the number of sides in each of the pot's polygonal <a href="#Rings">rings</a>. It's a tradeoff between smoothness and performance: the more sides there are, the smoother the pot's surface is, but the longer it takes to render the pot. Too few sides gives the pot a jagged, faceted appearance; excessive values make the application sluggish. The default value of 100 is a reasonable starting point.

<p>The Rings and Sides properties together determine the total number of facets, which is approximately Rings &times; Sides &times; 4. The exact number can be displayed via <a href="#Mesh_Information">Mesh Information</a>.

<p>Don't use the Sides property to create polygonal pots, because the resulting facet count will be too low to resolve other mesh effects. To create polygonal pots, use <a href="#Polygon_Sides">Polygon Sides</a> and the other polygon properties instead.

<a name="Radius"><h3>Radius</h3></a>

<p>This is a scaling factor applied to the overall radius of the pot. If it's one (the default), no scaling occurs. Values greater than one widen the pot, while values less than one narrow it. Any value other than one causes the pot to have different proportions than the <a href="#Spline">spline</a>. Note that you can also change the radius of the pot by moving the spline towards or away from the x-axis. Unlike the spline, the Radius property can be <a href="#Modulation">modulated</a> with a waveform.

<a name="Wall_Thickness"><h3>Wall Thickness</h3></a>

<p>This is the thickness of the pot's wall, in millimeters. Increasing this value makes the wall thicker. For variable wall thickness, apply a <a href="#Modulation">modulation</a> to this property.

<p><img src="https://victimofleisure.github.io/PotterDraw/Help/images/wall thickness = 15.jpg" width=192 height=256 title="Wall Thickness = 15">

<a name="Twist"><h3>Twist</h3></a>

<p>This is the amount of twist, as a <a href="#Normalized_angle">normalized angle</a>. Twist is a rotation applied to the pot while drawing it from bottom to top. It's easier to see the effect of twist if the pot has <a href="#Scallops">scallops</a>. For more complex twisting effects, modulate <a href="#Ring_Phase">Ring Phase</a>.

<p><img src="https://victimofleisure.github.io/PotterDraw/Help/images/scallops, twisted.jpg" width=192 height=256 title="Twisted Scallops">

<a name="Ring_Phase"><h3>Ring Phase</h3></a>

<p>This is the initial phase of each <a href="#Rings">ring</a>, as a <a href="#Normalized_angle">normalized angle</a>. Setting this property rotates the entire pot around its center axis. If you just want to see the pot from a different angle, it's usually preferable to <a href="#Rotation">rotate</a> the <a href="#View">view</a> instead, because doing so is very efficient, unlike rotating the pot which involves rebuilding the mesh.

<p>This property is primarily intended as a <a href="#Modulation">modulation</a> target, in order to achieve twisting effects by rotating each ring differently. The <a href="#Twist">Twist</a> property only supports simple linear twisting, whereas modulating Ring Phase allows many other types of twisting. The Twist property is equivalent to modulating Ring Phase with a <a href="#Range">unipolar</a> Ramp Up <a href="#Waveform">waveform</a>. Twist and Ring Phase modulation can also be combined for even more complex effects.

<a name="Aspect_Ratio"><h3>Aspect Ratio</h3></a>

<p>This scales the pot asymmetrically, making its cross-section elliptical instead of circular. For circular shapes, the aspect ratio should be one. Values greater than one make the pot wider in the x-axis. Values less than one make the pot narrower in the x-axis.

<p><img src="https://victimofleisure.github.io/PotterDraw/Help/images/aspect ratio.jpg" width=192 height=256 title="Aspect Ratio = 2">

<h3>Polygon</h3>

<a name="Polygon_Sides"><h4>Polygon Sides</h4></a>

<p>This is the number of sides a polygonal pot has. If this value is two or more, the polygon effect is enabled and the pot is polygonal. If it's less than two, the polygon effect is disabled and the pot is circular.

<p>The number of sides can be fractional. An integer number of sides produces a regular polygon, whereas a fractional number of sides produces a polygon with one side shorter than the others. The number of sides can be <a href="#Modulation">modulated</a> for interesting effects, but don't let the modulated value go below two, otherwise invalid geometry results.

<p>To round the polygon's corners, use <a href="#Polygon_Roundness">Polygon Roundness</a>. To bulge or pinch the polygon's sides, use <a href="#Polygon_Bulge">Polygon Bulge</a>.

<a name="Polygon_Roundness"><h4>Polygon Roundness</h4></a>

<p>For polygonal pots, this is the roundness of the polygon's corners. If this value is zero, the polygon has sharp corners. Positive values increase their roundness, up to one, which produces the circumscribed circle. Negative values also increase their roundness, but by shrinking instead of expanding the polygon, down to &minus;1, which produces the inscribed circle. Values outside the range &minus;1 to 1 are clamped. Note that this property has no effect unless <a href="#Polygon_Sides">Polygon Sides</a> is at least two. This property combines with <a href="#Polygon_Bulge">Polygon Bulge</a> to determine the polygon's shape.

<a name="Polygon_Bulge"><h4>Polygon Bulge</h4></a>

<p>For polygonal pots, this is how much the polygon's sides are bulged or pinched. If this value is zero, the polygon has straight sides. Positive values bulge them out, whereas negative values pinch them in. Note that this property has no effect unless <a href="#Polygon_Sides">Polygon Sides</a> is at least two. This property combines with <a href="#Polygon_Roundness">Polygon Roundness</a> to determine the polygon's shape.

<a name="Polygon_Phase"><h4>Polygon Phase</h4></a>

<p>For polygonal pots, this is the polygon's rotation, as a <a href="#Normalized_angle">normalized angle</a>. Note that this property has no effect unless <a href="#Polygon_Sides">Polygon Sides</a> is at least two.


<h3>Scallop</h3>

<a name="Scallops"><h4>Scallops</h4></a>

<p>Scallops are vertical grooves in the pot's wall, resulting from a <a href="#Scallop_Waveform">scallop waveform</a> that's <a href="#Scallop_Operation">applied</a> to the pot's radius. This property sets the number of scallops. For normal operation, use integer values; a fractional number of scallops may cause a sharp edge in the pot's surface. Note that this property has no effect unless <a href="#Scallop_Depth">Scallop Depth</a> is also non-zero.

<p><img src="https://victimofleisure.github.io/PotterDraw/Help/images/scallops=4.jpg" width=192 height=256 title="Scallops = 4">
<img src="https://victimofleisure.github.io/PotterDraw/Help/images/scallops.jpg" width=192 height=256 title="Scallops = 5">

<a name="Scallop_Depth"><h4>Scallop Depth</h4></a>

<p>This sets the depth of the <a href="#Scallops">scallops</a>, normally in millimeters. Note that this property has no effect unless Scallops is also non-zero. Also note that if <a href="#Scallop_Operation">Scallop Operation</a> is Multiply, Divide, or Exponentiate, the depth is used as a scaling factor and much smaller values are recommended.

<p><img src="https://victimofleisure.github.io/PotterDraw/Help/images/scallop depth less.jpg" width=192 height=256 title="Scallop Depth = 3">

<a name="Scallop_Phase"><h4>Scallop Phase</h4></a>

<p>This is the initial phase of the <a href="#Scallops">Scallops</a> waveform, as a <a href="#Normalized_angle">normalized angle</a>. This is useful if you want the waveform to start at a phase other than 0&deg;. Note that this property has no effect unless both Scallops and <a href="#Scallop_Depth">Scallop Depth</a> are non-zero. Applying a <a href="#Modulation">modulation</a> to this property results in wavy scallops.

<p><img src="https://victimofleisure.github.io/PotterDraw/Help/images/scallop phase modulation, unipolar.jpg" width=192 height=256 title="Scallop phase modulation, unipolar">

<a name="Scallop_Waveform"><h4>Scallop Waveform</h4></a>

<p>This selects which <a href="#Waveform">waveform</a> is used to create <a href="#Scallops">scallops</a>. The default is a sine wave.

<p>Note that the Ramp Up, Ramp Down, and Square waveforms may cause excessively thin radial walls. The same warning applies to pulse waveforms that lack sufficient <a href="#Slew">slew</a>.

<p>To create pinwheel shapes, use a Triangular Pulse with a <a href="#Pulse_Width">Pulse Width</a> of one, and skew the triangle via <a href="#Slew">Slew</a>.

<a name="Scallop_Operation"><h4>Scallop Operation</h4></a>

<p>This determines how the <a href="#Scallop_Waveform">scallop waveform</a> operates on the radius of each of the pot's <a href="#Rings">rings</a>. The following operations are available:

<p><table border=1 cellpadding=2 cellspacing=0>
<tr><th>Operation</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr><td>Add</td><td>The scallop waveform is added to the radius.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Subtract</td><td>The scallop waveform is subtracted from the radius.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Multiply</td><td>The radius is multiplied by the scallop waveform. If the waveform is positive, the radius is multiplied by the waveform plus one, otherwise it's multiplied by the waveform minus one.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Divide</td><td>The radius is divided by scallop waveform. If the waveform is positive, the radius is divided by the waveform plus one, otherwise it's divided by the waveform minus one.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Exponentiate</td><td>The waveform is used as an exponent, and the radius is multiplied by two raised to that exponent.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>For Add and Subtract, the scallop depth doesn't scale with radius. This may be undesirable if the pot's radius varies widely, because the scallops may appear too shallow where the pot is wide, or too deep where the pot is narrow. If you want the scallops to scale proportionally with radius, use Multiply, Divide, or Exponentiate.

<p>Exponentiate is optimal for proportional scaling. For example if the waveform ranges from &minus;1 to 1, Exponentiate produces values ranging from 2<sup>&minus;1</sup> to 2<sup>1</sup>, i.e. from &frac12; to 2. Thus the effect ranges from halving to doubling. Note that this assumes <a href="#Scallop_Depth">Scallop Depth</a> is one. If Scallop Depth were two, Exponentiate would produce values ranging from 2<sup>&minus;2</sup> to 2<sup>2</sup>, i.e. from &frac14; to 4 instead.

<a name="Scallop_Power"><h4>Scallop Power</h4></a>

<p>This is the base used for exponential <a href="#Scallops">Scallops</a>. If it's zero, exponential scallops are disabled. Otherwise, the curvature of the scallops becomes more extreme as the power diverges from one. This property lets you make a wider variety of shapes by distorting the <a href="#Scallop_Waveform">scallop waveform</a>. For more information, see <a href="#Power">Power</a>. Exponential power can be applied in different ways, depending on the <a href="#Scallop_Power_Type">Scallop Power Type</a>.

<a name="Scallop_Pulse_Width"><h4>Scallop Pulse Width</h4></a>

<p>This property only affects pulse <a href="#Scallop_Waveform">waveforms</a>, and together with <a href="#Scallop_Slew">Scallop Slew</a> it determines the pulse's shape. Also known as <em>duty cycle</em>, Pulse Width is the fraction of the cycle occupied by the pulse, normalized to the range zero to one.

<p>This property only affects pulse <a href="#Scallop_Waveform">waveforms</a>, and together with <a href="#Scallop_Pulse_Width">Scallop Pulse Width</a> it determines the pulse's shape. For the Pulse and Rounded Pulse waveforms, it sets how quickly the pulse rises and falls. For the Triangular Pulse waveform, it skews the triangle. For the Ramp Pulse waveform, it rotates the ramp. Slew is normalized to the range zero to one. For more information, see <a href="#Slew">Slew</a>.


<h3>Ripple</h3>

<a name="Ripples"><h4>Ripples</h4></a>

<p>Ripples are horizontal grooves in the pot's wall, resulting from a sine wave added to the pot's radius. This property sets the number of ripples. Note that this property has no effect unless <a href="#Ripple_Depth">Ripple Depth</a> is also non-zero.

<a name="Ripple_Phase"><h4>Ripple Phase</h4></a>

<p>This is the initial phase of the <a href="#Ripples">Ripples</a> waveform, as a <a href="#Normalized_angle">normalized angle</a>. This is useful if you want the waveform to start at a phase other than 0&deg;. Note that this property has no effect unless both Ripples and <a href="#Ripple_Depth">Ripple Depth</a> are non-zero.

<a name="Ripple_Motif"><h4>Ripple Motif</h4></a>

<p>This selects a decorative <a href="#Motif">motif</a> and applies it to the <a href="#Ripples">Ripples</a> waveform. Note that this property has no effect unless both Ripples and <a href="#Ripple_Depth">Ripple Depth</a> are non-zero.

<a name="Ripple_Operation"><h4>Ripple Operation</h4></a>

<p>This determines how the ripple waveform operates on the radius of each of the pot's <a href="#Rings">rings</a>. The available operations are listed below. If you want the ripples to scale proportionally with the pot's radius, use Exponentiate, typically with a much smaller <a href="#Ripple_Depth">Ripple Depth</a>.

<p><table border=1 cellpadding=2 cellspacing=0>
<tr><th>Operation</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr><td>Add</td><td>The ripple waveform is added to the radius.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Exponentiate</td><td>The waveform is used as an exponent, and the radius is multiplied by two raised to that exponent. </td></tr>
</table>

<p>If the pot's radius varies considerably, the Add operation may be unsatisfactory, because the ripples may be too deep in the pot's narrower portions, and too shallow in its wider portions. In such cases the Exponentiate operation may be preferable, because it proportionally scales the radius rather than offsetting it. Note that the reasonable range of Ripple Depth is much smaller for Exponentiate than it is for Add. With Add, a Ripple Depth of one is subtle, but with Exponentiate it produces ripples that extend from half the radius to double the radius, which is extreme. This is further explained below.

<p>The ripple waveform is <em>bipolar</em>, meaning it ranges from negative to positive Ripple Depth. Hence when it's used as an exponent, the resulting ripple multiplier ranges from a fraction to its reciprocal. For example, if Ripple Depth is one, the multiplier ranges from 2<sup>&minus;1</sup> to 2<sup>1</sup> (&frac12; to 2), whereas if Ripple Depth is two, the multiplier ranges from 2<sup>&minus;2</sup> to 2<sup>2</sup> (&frac14; to 4). A more moderate depth of 0.5 scales the radius by 2<sup>&minus;0.5</sup> to 2<sup>0.5</sup>, or 0.707 to 1.414.

<a name="Ripple_Power"><h4>Ripple Power</h4></a>

<p>This is the base used for exponential <a href="#Ripples">Ripples</a>. If it's zero, exponential ripples are disabled. Otherwise, the curvature of the ripples becomes more extreme as the power diverges from one. This property lets you make a wider variety of shapes by distorting the ripple waveform.

<a name="Ripple_Power_Type"><h4>Ripple Power Type</h4></a>

<p>This lets you select how exponential power is applied to the <a href="#Ripples">Ripples</a> waveform. It has no effect unless <a href="#Ripple_Power">Ripple Power</a> is non-zero. For more information, see <a href="#Power_Type">Power Type</a>.


<h3>Bend</h3>

<a name="Bends"><h4>Bends</h4></a>

<p>This sets the number of bends. Bends are sinusoidal offsets added to the pot's radius. The effect is similar to <a href="#Ripples">Ripples</a> but with an extra oscillator: in addition to the sine wave applied vertically to the pot's surface, a second sine wave is applied around the circumference of each ring. Bends can be used to create complex surfaces such as S-curves, honeycombs, bumps, and pits. For even more variety, a third oscillator is available; see <a href="#Ruffles">Ruffles</a>. Note that this property has no effect unless <a href="#Bend_Depth">Bend Depth</a> is also non-zero, and for typical usage, <a href="#Bend_Poles">Bend Poles</a> should also be non-zero.

<a name="Bend_Phase"><h4>Bend Phase</h4></a>

<p>This is the initial phase of the <a href="#Bends">Bends</a> waveform, as a <a href="#Normalized_angle">normalized angle</a>. This is useful if you want the waveform to start at a phase other than 0&deg;. Note that this property has no effect unless Bends and <a href="#Bend_Depth">Bend Depth</a> are both non-zero.

<a name="Bend_Motif"><h4>Bend Motif</h4></a>

<p>This selects a decorative <a href="#Motif">motif</a> and applies it to the <a href="#Bends">Bends</a> waveform. Note that this property has no effect unless Bends and <a href="#Bend_Depth">Bend Depth</a> are both non-zero. For more complex results, such as bumps and pits, you can also apply a motif to the <a href="#Bend_Poles">bend poles</a> waveform, via <a href="#Bend_Pole_Motif">Bend Pole Motif</a>.

<a name="Bend_Poles"><h4>Bend Poles</h4></a>

<p>This sets the frequency of the secondary oscillator in the <a href="#Bends">Bends</a> effect. If this property is zero, the bends effect is identical to <a href="#Ripples">Ripples</a>. For S-curves, use a value of one. For honeycomb effects, use values greater than one. For normal operation, use integer values; a fractional number of poles may cause thin-walled areas in the pot's surface. Note that this property has no effect unless Bends and <a href="#Bend_Depth">Bend Depth</a> are both non-zero.

<a name="Bend_Pole_Phase"><h4>Bend Pole Phase</h4></a>

<p>This is the initial phase of the <a href="#Bend_Poles">Bend Poles</a> waveform, as a <a href="#Normalized_angle">normalized angle</a>. This is useful if you want the waveform to start at a phase other than 0&deg;. Special effects similar to <a href="#Twist">twist</a> can be created by applying a <a href="#Modulation">modulation</a> to this property. Note that this property has no effect unless <a href="#Bends">Bends</a>, <a href="#Bend_Depth">Bend Depth</a> and Bend Poles are all non-zero.

<a name="Bend_Pole_Motif"><h4>Bend Pole Motif</h4></a>

<p>This selects a decorative <a href="#Motif">motif</a> and applies it to the <a href="#Bend_Poles">Bend Poles</a> waveform. Note that this property has no effect unless <a href="#Bends">Bends</a>, <a href="#Bend_Depth">Bend Depth</a> and Bend Poles are all non-zero. For bumps, set this property and <a href="#Bend_Motif">Bend Motif</a> to Parted Reeds; for pits, set them both to Parted Flutes.

<a name="Bend_Operation"><h4>Bend Operation</h4></a>

<p>This determines how the bend waveform operates on the radius of each of the pot's <a href="#Rings">rings</a>. The available operations are listed below. If you want the bends to scale proportionally with the pot's radius, use Exponentiate, typically with a much smaller <a href="#Bend_Depth">Bend Depth</a>.

<p><table border=1 cellpadding=2 cellspacing=0>
<tr><th>Operation</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr><td>Add</td><td>The bend waveform is added to the radius.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Exponentiate</td><td>The waveform is used as an exponent, and the radius is multiplied by two raised to that exponent. </td></tr>
</table>

<p>If the pot's radius varies considerably, the Add operation may be unsatisfactory, because the bends may be too deep in the pot's narrower portions, and too shallow in its wider portions. In such cases the Exponentiate operation may be preferable, because it proportionally scales the radius rather than offsetting it. Note that the reasonable range of Bend Depth is much smaller for Exponentiate than it is for Add. With Add, a Bend Depth of one is subtle, but with Exponentiate it produces bends that extend from half the radius to double the radius, which is extreme. This is further explained below.

<p>The bend waveform is <em>bipolar</em>, meaning it ranges from negative to positive Bend Depth. Hence when it's used as an exponent, the resulting bend multiplier ranges from a fraction to its reciprocal. For example, if Bend Depth is one, the multiplier ranges from 2<sup>&minus;1</sup> to 2<sup>1</sup> (&frac12; to 2), whereas if Bend Depth is two, the multiplier ranges from 2<sup>&minus;2</sup> to 2<sup>2</sup> (&frac14; to 4). A more moderate depth of 0.5 scales the radius by 2<sup>&minus;0.5</sup> to 2<sup>0.5</sup>, or 0.707 to 1.414.

<a name="Bend_Power"><h4>Bend Power</h4></a>

<p>This is the base used for exponential <a href="#Bends">Bends</a>. If it's zero, exponential bends are disabled. Otherwise, the curvature of the bends becomes more extreme as the power diverges from one. This property lets you make a wider variety of shapes by distorting the bend waveform. For more information, see <a href="#Power">Power</a>. Exponential power can be applied in different ways, depending on the <a href="#Bend_Power_Type">Bend Power Type</a>.

<a name="Bend_Power_Type"><h4>Bend Power Type</h4></a>

<p>This lets you select how exponential power is applied to the <a href="#Bends">Bends</a> waveform. It has no effect unless <a href="#Bend_Power">Bend Power</a> is non-zero. For more information, see <a href="#Power_Type">Power Type</a>.

<h4>Ruffle</h4>

<a name="Ruffles"><h5>Ruffles</h5></a>

<p>This sets the number of ruffles. Ruffles are essentially wavy ripples, and they're an optional feature of the <a href="#Bends">Bend</a> effect. The Bend effect consists of three LFOs (Low Frequency Oscillators), which interact to change the pot's radius, as follows:

<p><table border=1 cellpadding=2 cellspacing=0>
<tr><th>LFO</th><th>Function</th></tr>
<tr><td>Bend</td><td>This LFO varies the radius periodically with vertical position; by itself it's identical to <a href="#Ripples">Ripples</a>.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Pole</td><td>This LFO varies the radius periodically with angle, similarly to <a href="#Scallops">Scallops</a>; in combination with the Bend LFO, it creates honeycomb-like effects.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Ruffle</td><td>This LFO also varies with angle, but instead of changing the radius, it changes the <em>phase</em> of the Bend LFO. This produces wavy ripples, also known as ruffles.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>You can have poles without ruffles, or ruffles without poles, but the Pole and Ruffle LFOs both depend on the Bend LFO. To enable ruffles, the <a href="#Bends">Bends</a>, <a href="#Bend_Depth">Bend Depth</a>, Ruffles, and <a href="#Ruffle_Depth">Ruffle Depth</a> properties must all be non-zero.

<p><img src="../https://victimofleisure.github.io/PotterDraw/Help/images/ruffles.jpg" width=192 height=256 title="Ruffles">

<a name="Ruffle_Depth"><h5>Ruffle Depth</h5></a>

<p>This sets the depth of the <a href="#Ruffles">ruffles</a>. It's normalized such that a value of one yields ruffles twice the height of the pot. Much smaller values are recommended, for example 0.1 is a reasonable starting value. Note that to enable ruffles, the <a href="#Bends">Bends</a>, <a href="#Bend_Depth">Bend Depth</a>, Ruffles, and <a href="#Ruffle_Depth">Ruffle Depth</a> properties must all be non-zero.

<a name="Ruffle_Phase"><h5>Ruffle Phase</h5></a>

<p>This is the initial phase of the <a href="#Ruffles">Ruffles</a> waveform, as a <a href="#Normalized_angle">normalized angle</a>. This is useful if you want the <a href="#Waveform">waveform</a> to start at a phase other than 0&deg;. Ruffle Phase is <em>relative</em> to <a href="#Bend_Pole_Phase">Bend Pole Phase</a>; in other words, it's the rotational difference between the ruffles and the poles. Note that this property has no effect unless <a href="#Bends">Bends</a>, <a href="#Bend_Depth">Bend Depth</a>, Ruffles, and <a href="#Ruffle_Depth">Ruffle Depth</a> are all non-zero.

<a name="Ruffle_Waveform"><h5>Ruffle Waveform</h5></a>

<p>This selects which <a href="#Waveform">waveform</a> is used to create <a href="#Ruffles">ruffles</a>. The default is a sine wave. Note that this property has no effect unless <a href="#Bends">Bends</a>, <a href="#Bend_Depth">Bend Depth</a>, Ruffles, and <a href="#Ruffle_Depth">Ruffle Depth</a> are all non-zero.

<a name="Ruffle_Motif"><h5>Ruffle Motif</h5></a>

<p>This selects a decorative <a href="#Motif">motif</a> and applies it to the <a href="#Ruffles">Ruffles</a> waveform. Note that this property has no effect unless <a href="#Bends">Bends</a>, <a href="#Bend_Depth">Bend Depth</a>, Ruffles, and <a href="#Ruffle_Depth">Ruffle Depth</a> are all non-zero.

<a name="Ruffle_Power"><h5>Ruffle Power</h5></a>

<p>This is the base used for exponential <a href="#Ruffles">Ruffles</a>. If it's zero, exponential ruffles are disabled. Otherwise, the curvature of the ruffles becomes more extreme as the power diverges from one. This property lets you make a wider variety of shapes by distorting the <a href="#Ruffle_Waveform">ruffle waveform</a>. For more information, see <a href="#Power">Power</a>. Exponential power can be applied in different ways, depending on the <a href="#Ruffle_Power_Type">Ruffle Power Type</a>. Note that this property has no effect unless <a href="#Bends">Bends</a>, <a href="#Bend_Depth">Bend Depth</a>, Ruffles, and <a href="#Ruffle_Depth">Ruffle Depth</a> are all non-zero.

<a name="Ruffle_Power_Type"><h5>Ruffle Power Type</h5></a>

<p>This lets you select how exponential power is applied to the <a href="#Ruffles">Ruffles</a> waveform. It has no effect unless <a href="#Ruffle_Power">Ruffle Power</a> is non-zero. For more information, see <a href="#Power_Type">Power Type</a>.

<a name="Ruffle_Pulse_Width"><h5>Ruffle Pulse Width</h5></a>

<p>This property only affects pulse <a href="#Ruffle_Waveform">waveforms</a>, and together with <a href="#Ruffle_Slew">Ruffle Slew</a> it determines the pulse's shape. Also known as <em>duty cycle</em>, Pulse Width is the fraction of the cycle occupied by the pulse, normalized to the range zero to one. For more information, see <a href="#Pulse_Width">Pulse Width</a>.

<a name="Ruffle_Slew"><h5>Ruffle Slew</h5></a>

<p>This property only affects pulse <a href="#Ruffle_Waveform">waveforms</a>, and together with <a href="#Ruffle_Pulse_Width">Ruffle Pulse Width</a> it determines the pulse's shape. For the Pulse and Rounded Pulse waveforms, it sets how quickly the pulse rises and falls. For the Triangular Pulse waveform, it skews the triangle. For the Ramp Pulse waveform, it rotates the ramp. Slew is normalized to the range zero to one. For more information, see <a href="#Slew">Slew</a>.



<h3>Helix</h3>

<a name="Helix_Frequency"><h4>Helix Frequency</h4></a>

<p>The Helix effect is a sinusoidal displacement added to the origin of each of the pot's <a href="#Rings">rings</a>. The resulting effect resembles a corkscrew. Helix is similar to <a href="#Twist">Twist</a>, except that Twist affects the radius whereas Helix affects the origin. This property sets the frequency of the helix, as a <a href="#Normalized_angle">normalized angle</a>; it determines the number of 360&deg; rotations over the height of the pot. Note that this property has no effect unless <a href="#Helix_Amplitude">Helix Amplitude</a> is also non-zero.

<p><img src="https://victimofleisure.github.io/PotterDraw/Help/images/helix.jpg" width=192 height=256 title="helix, frequency = 1, amplitude = 10">

<a name="Helix_Amplitude"><h4>Helix Amplitude</h4></a>

<p>This is the amplitude of the helical displacement, in millimeters. Note that this property has no effect unless <a href="#Helix_Frequency">Helix Frequency</a> is also non-zero.



<h2>Texture</h2>

<a name="Texture_Path"><h3>Texture Path</h3></a>

<p>This is the path to an image file containing a texture to display on the pot. Supported image formats include bitmap (BMP), PNG, and JPEG; for a complete list, see below. If this property is blank, a texture is <a href="#Texture_synthesis">synthesized</a> using the current palette and color properties.

<p>To load a texture, left-click the property to display a browse button on the right; then left-click the browse button to display a file dialog, navigate to the desired folder, select the image file, and press OK. You can also type or paste a path if you prefer.

<p>You can also load a texture via the File menu's <a href="#Load_Texture">Load Texture</a> command, or by dragging and dropping a suitable file from Explorer onto PotterDraw's main window.

<p>How the texture is mapped onto the pot is determined by various properties, most importantly the <a href="#Color_Pattern">color pattern</a>. To minimize image distortion, use either Stripes or Polar mapping, with specific values for certain properties, as shown below.

<p><table border=1 cellpadding=2 cellspacing=0>
<tr><th>Color Pattern</th><th>Color Cycles</th><th>Stripes Frequency</th><th>Stripes Amplitude</th><th>Cycles V</th></tr>
<tr><td>Stripes</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>&minus;1</td></tr>
<tr><td>Polar</td><td>N/A</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>N/A</td></tr>
</table>

<p>The following file formats can be used as texture:

<p><table border=1 cellpadding=2 cellspacing=0>
<tr><th>Type</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr><td>BMP</td><td>Windows bitmap (BMP) file format.</td></tr>
<tr><td>DDS</td><td>DirectDraw surface (DDS) file format.</td></tr>
<tr><td>DIB</td><td>Windows device-independent bitmap (DIB) file format.</td></tr>

<tr><td>PFM</td><td>Portable float map file format.</td></tr>
<tr><td>PNG</td><td>Portable Network Graphics (PNG) file format.</td></tr>
<tr><td>PPM</td><td>Portable pixmap (PPM) file format.</td></tr>
<tr><td>TGA</td><td>Truevision (Targa, or TGA) image file format.</td></tr>
</table>

<a name="Colors"><h3>Colors</h3></a>

<p>This is the number of colors in the <a href="#Palette">palette</a> used for <a href="#Texture_synthesis">texture synthesis</a>. The number of colors can also be changed by adding or deleting colors in the Palette Bar. This property only affects synthesized texture; it has no effect if the texture is an <a href="#Texture_Path">image file</a>.

<a name="Color_Sharpness"><h3>Color Sharpness</h3></a>

<p>This sets the sharpness or fuzziness of the colors used for <a href="#Texture_synthesis">texture synthesis</a>. For maximum sharpness, use 100; for maximum fuzziness and blending, use 1. Technically this property determines the width (in pixels) of each color in the <a href="#Palette">palette</a>. This property only affects synthesized texture; it has no effect if the texture is an <a href="#Texture_Path">image file</a>.

<p><img src="https://victimofleisure.github.io/PotterDraw/Help/images/color sharpness = 100.jpg" width=192 height=256 title="Color Sharpness = 100">
<img src="https://victimofleisure.github.io/PotterDraw/Help/images/color sharpness = 1.jpg" width=192 height=256 title="Color Sharpness = 1">

<a name="Color_Cycles"><h3>Color Cycles</h3></a>

<p>This sets how many times the <a href="#Colors">colors</a> are cycled in <a href="#Texture_synthesis">synthesized</a> textures. It also affects the mapping of image file textures. In general larger values make the texture busier. Notes that this property has no effect on the Polar <a href="#Color_Pattern">color pattern</a>.

<a name="Stripe_Frequency"><h3>Stripe Frequency</h3></a>

<p>The stripes effect generates sinusoidal waves in the pot's texture. The waveform is applied to the texture coordinates, so it affects both <a href="#Texture_synthesis">synthesized</a> and <a href="#Texture_Path">image file</a> textures. This property sets the frequency of the stripes effect, as a number of cycles. Note that this property has no effect unless <a href="#Stripe_Amplitude">Stripe Amplitude</a> is also non-zero.

<img src="https://victimofleisure.github.io/PotterDraw/Help/images/color pattern wavy rings.jpg" width=192 height=256 title="Wavy Rings">

<a name="Stripe_Amplitude"><h3>Stripe Amplitude</h3></a>

<p>This sets the amplitude of the <a href="#Stripe_Frequency">stripes</a> effect. Note that this property has no effect unless Stripe Frequency is also non-zero.

<a name="Stripe_Phase"><h3>Stripe Phase</h3></a>

<p>This is the initial phase of the <a href="#Stripe_Frequency">stripes</a> waveform, as a <a href="#Normalized_angle">normalized angle</a>. This is useful if you want the waveform to start at a phase other than 0&deg;. Note that this property has no effect unless both Stripe Frequency and <a href="#Stripe_Amplitude">Stripe Amplitude</a> are non-zero.

<a name="Petals"><h3>Petals</h3></a>

<p>This sets the number of petals generated by the Petals <a href="#Color_Pattern">Color Pattern</a>. It has no effect on other color patterns.

<a name="Color_Pattern"><h3>Color Pattern</h3></a>

<p>This selects a color pattern, which determines how the current texture is mapped onto the pot. Color patterns are trigonometric mapping functions that generate a two-dimensional texture coordinate for each of the pot's vertices. The mapping affects both <a href="#Texture_synthesis">synthesized</a> and <a href="#Texture_Path">user-specified</a> textures. By convention the two texture coordinate axes are named U and V, to avoid confusion with the Cartesian axes. The color pattern selection affects which texture properties are applicable; see <a href="#Texture_Property_Usage">Texture Property Usage</a>.

<p><table border=1 cellpadding=2 cellspacing=0>
<tr><th>Pattern</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr><td>Stripes</td><td>This function generates vertical stripes. The stripes can be made wavy by setting <a href="#Stripe_Frequency">Stripe Frequency</a> and <a href="#Stripe_Amplitude">Stripe Amplitude</a> non-zero. More complex waviness can be achieved by applying <a href="#Modulation">modulations</a> to the Stripe properties. The Stripes function is also useful for typical cylindrical texture mapping, in which an image is wrapped around the cylinder like a sheet of paper. In this case, to minimize distortion, set stripe amplitude to zero.

<tr><td>Rings</td><td>This function generates horizontal rings. The rings can be made wavy by setting Stripe Frequency and Stripe Amplitude non-zero.

<tr><td>Petals</td><td>This function generates petal-like shapes. It's affected by the stripe frequency and amplitude. The <a href="#Petals">Petals</a> property determines the number of petals.

</td></tr>
<tr><td>Polar</td><td>This function uses polar coordinates to map a circular image onto the pot, such that the center of the image is mapped to the center of the pot's bottom. This function is primarily intended for use with a square <a href="#Texture_Path">user-specified texture</a> containing a circular, radially symmetrical pattern that's centered within the square. Note that for typical polar mapping, both Stripe Frequency and Stripe Amplitude should be one. Use Stripe Phase to rotate the texture around the center, and V Offset to shift it vertically. The V axis is alternately flipped for smooth wrapping.
<p><img src="https://victimofleisure.github.io/PotterDraw/Help/images/color pattern polar.jpg" width=192 height=256 title="Polar">
</td></tr>
<tr><td>Radius</td><td>This function uses the radius as the U coordinate, resulting in a texture mapping that illustrates the contours of the pot. It's more interesting if the pot isn't circular, e.g. if it's <a href="#Polygon_Sides">polygonal</a> or has <a href="#Scallops">scallops</a>. The radius is normalized so that when Color Cycles is one, the pot's range of radius matches the range of the U coordinate. Use <a href="#U_Offset">U Offset</a> to shift the radius mapping. This function doesn't use Stripe Frequency or Stripe Amplitude.
<p><img src="https://victimofleisure.github.io/PotterDraw/Help/images/color pattern radius.jpg" width=192 height=256 title="Radius">
</td></tr>
<tr><td>Azimuth</td><td>This function sets the U coordinates according to how non-round the surface is. The azimuthal portion of each vertex normal is compared to a circular reference, yielding an angle of deviation from circular, in normalized degrees. The azimuthal deviation is multiplied by Color Cycles and has U Offset added to it. This function is only useful if some portion of the pot isn't round.
<p><img src="https://victimofleisure.github.io/PotterDraw/Help/images/color pattern azimuth.jpg" width=192 height=256 title="Azimuth">
</td></tr>
<tr><td>Incline</td><td>This function sets the U coordinates according to how non-vertical the surface is. The inclinational portion of each vertex normal is compared to a vertical reference, yielding an angle of deviation from vertical, in normalized degrees. The inclinational deviation is multiplied by Color Cycles and has U Offset added to it. This function is only useful if some portion of the pot isn't vertical.
<p><img src="https://victimofleisure.github.io/PotterDraw/Help/images/color pattern incline.jpg" width=192 height=256 title="Incline">
</td></tr>
<tr><td>Azimuth & Incline</td><td>This function combines the Azimuth and Incline functions described above. Azimuthal deviation (non-roundness) controls the U coordinate, while inclinational deviation (non-verticalness) controls the V coordinate. The resulting texture mapping fully illustrates the pot's 3D curvature.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Edges</td><td>This function sets the U coordinates according to how much the curvature varies. This causes edges to be highlighted in proportion to how sharp they are. Specifically, for each vertex, the standard deviation of the adjacent face normals is computed. The more the normals deviate, the larger the corresponding U coordinate value is. The sensitivity of the edge detection is adjustable via the <a href="#Edge_Gain">Edge Gain</a> property.

<tr><th>Type</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr><td>Linear</td><td>The palette colors are mapped into a one-dimensional texture.

<a name="U_Offset"><h3>U Offset</h3></a>

<p>This is an offset added to the U-value of texture coordinates. Its effect depends on which <a href="#Color_Pattern">color pattern</a> is in use. Texture coordinates are normalized from zero to one.

<a name="V_Offset"><h3>V Offset</h3></a>

<p>This is an offset added to the V-value of texture coordinates. Its effect depends on which <a href="#Color_Pattern">color pattern</a> is in use. Texture coordinates are normalized from zero to one.

<a name="Cycles_V"><h3>Cycles V</h3></a>

<p>This sets the number of times the V-value of texture coordinates is cycled during texture mapping. Values greater than one cause the texture to be repeated in the V-axis.

<a name="Edge_Gain"><h3>Edge Gain</h3></a>

<p>This sets the sensitivity of the Edges <a href="#Color_Pattern">color pattern</a>. The larger its value, the more edges are amplified. In other words, the larger its value, the less variation it takes for an area to be considered an edge. The edge detection algorithm computes the standard deviation of the adjacent face normals at each vertex. The deviation is then logarithmically scaled, in order to amplify small differences. Edge Gain controls the amount of scaling. It's a base ten exponent, so each successive integer is ten times more gain, i.e. 1 is x10, 2 is x100, 3 is x1000, etc.

<p>Edge sensitivity is also affected by the mesh density, which is determined by <a href="#Rings">Rings</a> and <a href="#Sides">Sides</a>. If either of these properties are changed significantly, the edge areas may grow or shrink, and you may need to adjust Edge Gain to compensate.


<h2>View</h2>

<a name="Animation"><h3>Animation</h3></a>

<p>This enables or disables the animation of any mesh or texture <a href="#Properties">properties</a> that are ready to animate. A property is ready to animate if has an active <a href="#Modulation">modulation</a> with a non-zero <a href="#Phase_Speed">Phase Speed</a>. Modulation and animation readiness are indicated by the presence and color of an upward-pointing triangle to the left of the property's name in the Properties bar, as shown in the table below.

<p><table border=1 cellpadding=2 cellspacing=0>
<tr><th>Triangle</th><th>Meaning</th></tr>
<tr><td>None</td><td>The property isn't modulated. To modulate it, set its <a href="#Waveform">Waveform</a> to a value other than None, and configure other modulation parameters as needed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Blue</td><td>The property is modulated, but not ready to animate. To make it ready, set its Phase Speed to a non-zero value.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Orange</td><td>The property is ready to animate, but animation is disabled.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Green</td><td>The property is animating.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>To enable animation, set the Animation property to true, or use the <a href="#Enable_Animation">View/Animation</a> main menu command. Enabling animation causes the <a href="#View">view</a> to automatically update itself at the current <a href="#Frame_Rate">frame rate</a>. For every frame, PotterDraw iterates through the animated properties and advances their oscillators by the appropriate amount.

<a name="Frame_Rate"><h3>Frame Rate</h3></a>

<p>This sets the frame rate in frames per second. It's only  relevant during <a href="#Animation">animation</a>, <a href="#Auto_Rotate">auto-rotation</a> or video <a href="#Record">recording</a>.

<a name="Background_Color"><h3>Background Color</h3></a>

<p>This sets the <a href="#View">view</a>'s background color. To pick a color, left-click the down-arrow button on the right side of the property's value. A small drop-down palette is displayed. If the desired color is available, select it by left-clicking its swatch, otherwise left-click "More Colors" to display a color dialog. You can also enter a numeric color value in hexadecimal.

<h3>Auto Rotate</h3>

<a name="Auto_Rotate_Yaw"><h4>Auto Rotate Yaw</h4></a>

<p>This sets the yaw speed when <a href="#Auto_Rotate">auto-rotating</a> the <a href="#View">view</a>, in degrees per second.

<a name="Auto_Rotate_Pitch"><h4>Auto Rotate Pitch</h4></a>

<p>This sets the pitch speed when <a href="#Auto_Rotate">auto-rotating</a> the <a href="#View">view</a>, in degrees per second.

<a name="Auto_Rotate_Roll"><h4>Auto Rotate Roll</h4></a>

<p>This sets the roll speed when <a href="#Auto_Rotate">auto-rotating</a> the <a href="#View">view</a>, in degrees per second.

<a name="Auto_Rotate_Zoom"><h4>Auto Rotate Zoom</h4></a>

<p>This sets the zoom speed when <a href="#Auto_Rotate">auto-rotating</a> the <a href="#View">view</a>, in percent per second. Use a positive percentage to zoom in, or a negative percentage to zoom out. Automatic zoom can be useful for demos or when <a href="#Record">recording</a> a video.

<p>If you're making a video, you may want to know what auto-zoom percentage will reach a given scaling by the end of the video. The calculation is as follows:

<p>AutoZoom = (exp(log(Scaling) / Duration)) - 1) * 100

<p>For example to zoom by 5x (500%) over 30 seconds:

<p>AutoZoom = (exp(log(5) / 30) - 1) * 100
<br>AutoZoom = 5.5113




<h1>Modulation</h1>

<a name="Modulation"><h2>Modulation</h2></a>

<p>PotterDraw <a href="#Properties">properties</a> can be modified by oscillators, a process called <em>modulation</em>. Most mesh and texture properties can be modulated, with a few <a href="#Target">exceptions</a>. Each property has its own Low-Frequency Oscillator (LFO), allowing multiple properties to be modulated at once. The LFO outputs a periodic <a href="#Waveform">waveform</a> having a user-specified <a href="#Frequency">frequency</a> and <a href="#Amplitude">amplitude</a>. This waveform is applied to the property using an <a href="#Operation">operation</a> such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division.

<p>The waveform's cycle is synchronized with vertical position on the pot. In other words, if the modulation frequency is one, the waveform completes one cycle from the bottom to the top of the pot. The waveform's cycle can also be varied over <em>time</em> during <a href="#Animation">animation</a>; this is accomplished by setting the modulation's <a href="#Phase_Speed">phase speed</a>.

<p>Modulation can be used as an <em>envelope</em> that incrementally increases or decreases the strength of an effect. This lets you limit the scope of a property, so that instead of affecting the entire pot, it only affects a given subset of the pot's <a href="#Rings">rings</a>.

<p>You can also modulate your modulations; see <a href="#Secondary_modulation">secondary modulation</a>.

<a name="Creating_modulations"><h3>Creating modulations</h3></a>

<p>To create a <a href="#Modulation">modulation</a>, first show the Modulation bar, via <span class="cmd">View/Toolbars and Docking Windows/Modulation</span>. Then select the desired <a href="#Target">target</a> property, by left-clicking its name in the Properties bar, or by selecting it in the Modulation bar's Target drop-list. Now make the modulation active by setting its Waveform to a value other than None. You may also want to change the other modulation parameters.

<p>A modulated property has an upward-pointing triangle to the left of its name in the Properties bar. The triangle's color indicates the property's <a href="#Animation">animation</a> state: green or orange if the property is animating or ready to animate, otherwise blue.

<p>It may be helpful to also show the <a href="#Oscilloscope">Oscilloscope</a> bar, which draws a plot of the currently selected property's modulation.

<a name="Target"><h2>Target</h2></a>

<p>This specifies which PotterDraw <a href="#Properties">property</a> the <a href="#Modulation">Modulation</a> bar is currently affecting, also known as the <em>target</em> property. It contains a drop list of all the <a href="#Properties">properties</a> that can be modulated. You can also change the modulation target by left-clicking a property name in the Properties bar.

<p>Most target properties are floating-point values, but enumerated values such as <a href="#Scallop_Motif">Scallop Motif</a> can also be modulated. Note that the following properties can't be modulated: <a href="#Rings">Rings</a>, <a href="#Sides">Sides</a>, <a href="#Texture_Path">Texture Path</a>, <a href="#Colors">Colors</a>, <a href="#Color_Sharpness">Color Sharpness</a>, and <a href="#Palette_Type">Palette Type</a>.

<a name="Type"><h2>Type</h2></a>

<p>This enables <a href="#Secondary_modulation">secondary modulation</a>, an <b>advanced feature</b>. If you're new to PotterDraw, leave this set to "Property". This setting changes the meaning of both the <a href="#Modulation">modulation</a> bar and the <a href="#Oscilloscope">oscilloscope</a>, as explained below.

<p><table border=1 cellpadding=2 cellspacing=0>
<tr><th>Type</th><th>Meaning</th><th>Comment</th></tr>
<tr><td>Property</td><td>Primary modulation</td><td>The modulation bar edits the <em>primary modulation</em>, i.e. the LFO that directly modulates the currently selected <a href="#Target">target</a> property. Similarly, the oscilloscope plots the modulated target property. This is the default setting. Don't change it unless you're an advanced user.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Any other value</td><td>Secondary modulation</td><td>The modulation bar edits a <em>secondary modulation</em>, i.e. an LFO that modulates one of the primary modulation's properties. This allows modulation of a modulation, also known as <em>second-order</em> modulation. In this case the oscilloscope plots the secondary modulation instead of the target property, and the name of the affected modulation property is highlighted in red as a reminder.</td></tr>

<a name="Waveform"><h2>Waveform</h2></a>

<p>This lets you select a <a href="#Modulation">modulation</a> waveform. If it's None, modulation is disabled for the <a href="#Target">target</a> property. The following waveforms are available:

<p><table border=1 cellpadding=2 cellspacing=0>
<tr><th>Waveform</th><th>Description</th></tr>

<a name="Operation"><h2>Operation</h2></a>

<p>This lets you specify how the <a href="#Modulation">modulation</a> affects the <a href="#Target">target</a> property. The following operations are available:

<p><table border=1 cellpadding=2 cellspacing=0>
<tr><th>Operation</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr><td>Add</td><td>The modulation output is added to the target property.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Subtract</td><td>The modulation output is subtracted from the target property.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Multiply</td><td>The target property is multiplied by the modulation output.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Divide</td><td>The target property is divided by the modulation output. The user is responsible for ensuring that the modulation doesn't output zero.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Exponentiate</td><td>The waveform is used as an exponent, and the target property is multiplied by two raised to that exponent.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Exponentiate is optimal for proportional scaling. For example if the waveform ranges from &minus;1 to 1, Exponentiate produces values ranging from 2<sup>&minus;1</sup> to 2<sup>1</sup>, i.e. from &frac12; to 2. Thus the effect ranges from halving to doubling. Note that this assumes <a href="#Amplitude">Amplitude</a> is one. If Amplitude were two, Exponentiate would produce values ranging from 2<sup>&minus;2</sup> to 2<sup>2</sup>, i.e. from &frac14; to 4 instead.

<a name="Range"><h2>Range</h2></a>

<p>This lets you select the range of the <a href="#Modulation">modulation</a> oscillator. The following normalized ranges are available:

<p><table border=1 cellpadding=2 cellspacing=0>
<tr><th>Range</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr><td>Bipolar</td><td>The oscillator's output ranges from &minus;1 to 1.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Unipolar</td><td>The oscillator's output ranges from 0 to 1.</td></tr>
</table>

<a name="Motif"><h2>Motif</h2></a>

<p>This selects a motif and applies it to the <a href="#Modulation">modulation</a> oscillator. A <em>motif</em> is a decorative embellishment of a periodic waveform. It can emulate various types of <em>gadrooning</em>&mdash;specifically <em>reeding</em> and <em>fluting</em>&mdash;commonly seen in classical architecture and furniture design. The table below explains the available motifs.

<p><table border=1 cellpadding=2 cellspacing=0>
<tr><th>Motif</th><th>Appearance</th><th>Method</th><th>Expression</th></tr>
<tr><td>Invert</td><td>Opposite</td><td>Negative values are made positive, and vice versa; inversion</td><td>&minus;x</td></tr>
<tr><td>Reeds</td><td>Convex ridges</td><td>Negative values are made positive; full-wave rectification</td><td>abs(x)</td></tr>
<tr><td>Flutes</td><td>Concave grooves</td><td>Positive values are made negative; inverted full-wave rectification</td><td>&minus;abs(x)</td></tr>
<tr><td>Parted Reeds</td><td>Convex ridges separated by gaps</td><td>Negative values are zeroed; half-wave rectification</td><td>max(x,&nbsp;0)</td></tr>
<tr><td>Parted Flutes</td><td>Concave grooves separated by gaps</td><td>Positive values are zeroed; inverted half-wave rectification</td><td>min(x,&nbsp;0)</td></tr>
</table>

<p><img src="https://victimofleisure.github.io/PotterDraw/Help/images/motifs.png" width=326 height=298 title="Motifs">

<a name="Frequency"><h2>Frequency</h2></a>

<p>This sets the frequency of the <a href="#Modulation">modulation</a> oscillator. The frequency is in cycles per pot height, i.e. if the frequency is one, the waveform does one complete cycle from the bottom to the top of the pot. If the frequency is zero, the modulation output doesn't vary with vertical position, but it may still vary with time, if <a href="#Phase_Speed">phase speed</a> is non-zero and <a href="#Animation">animation</a> is enabled.

<a name="Amplitude"><h2>Amplitude</h2></a>

<p>This sets the amplitude of the <a href="#Modulation">modulation</a> oscillator. The unit is the same as the <a href="#Target">target</a> property's unit.

<a name="Phase"><h2>Phase</h2></a>

<p>This is the initial phase of the <a href="#Modulation">modulation</a> oscillator, as a <a href="#Normalized_angle">normalized angle</a>. This is useful if you want the <a href="#Waveform">waveform</a> to start at a phase other than 0&deg;. The phase can also be automatically incremented for each frame of an <a href="#Animation">animation</a>, by setting a non-zero <a href="#Phase_Speed">Phase Speed</a>.

<a name="Phase_Speed"><h2>Phase Speed</h2></a>

<p>This sets how rapidly the <a href="#Modulation">modulation</a> changes <a href="#Phase">phase</a> during <a href="#Animation">animation</a>, in Hertz (cycles per second). Note that this property is only effective while animation is enabled, otherwise it's ignored. If it's zero, time has no effect on the oscillator. If it's negative, the oscillator runs backwards. Normally the modulation also varies with vertical position, but you can disable this by setting the modulation <a href="#Frequency">frequency</a> to zero.

<a name="Bias"><h2>Bias</h2></a>

<p>This is an offset added to the <a href="#Modulation">modulation</a>, before it's scaled by the <a href="#Amplitude">amplitude</a>. The bias is in oscillator normalized units, which means one cycle corresponds to [&minus;1..1] or [0..1] depending on the <a href="#Range">range</a> setting.

<a name="Power"><h2>Power</h2></a>

<p>This is the base used for exponential <a href="#Modulation">modulation</a>. If it's zero, exponential modulation is disabled. Otherwise, the modulation's curvature becomes more extreme as the power diverges from one, as shown in the table below. This property supports a huge range of values, so it's usually best to change it by large amounts, e.g. powers of ten.

<p><table border=1 cellpadding=2 cellspacing=0>
<tr><th>Value</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr><td>&lt;&nbsp;0</td><td>Not allowed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>0</td><td>Linear (disabled).</td></tr>
<tr><td>0&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;x&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;1</td><td>Starts out curving more steeply and then levels off; the smaller the value, the more extreme the curvature.</td></tr>
<tr><td>1</td><td>Linear. Use zero instead to avoid needless computations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>&gt;&nbsp;1</td><td>Starts out curving more gradually and then gets steeper; the larger the value, the more extreme the curvature.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Exponential modulation is also affected by <a href="#Power_Type">Power Type</a>. If the power type is <em>asymmetric</em>, the wave's upper and lower halves are affected differently, in which case a given power and its reciprocal (e.g. 10 and 0.1) produce mirror images of each other. If the power type is <em>symmetric</em>, the wave's upper and lower halves are affected equally, and the wave's vertical symmetry (if any) is preserved. The image below shows how a range of powers affect a sine wave, for both power types. Other <a href="#Waveform">waveforms</a> respond similarly.

<a name="Power_Type"><h2>Power Type</h2></a>

<p>This determines how exponential <a href="#Power">power</a> is applied to the <a href="#Waveform">waveform</a> during <a href="#Modulation">modulation</a>. The available methods are listed below, and illustrated <a href="#Power">here</a>.

<p><table border=1 cellpadding=2 cellspacing=0>
<tr><th>Power Type</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr><td>Asymmetric</td><td>Power is applied while the wave is <em>unipolar</em>, so that the wave's upper and lower halves are affected differently, giving the wave a lopsided appearance. </td></tr>
<tr><td>Symmetric</td><td>Power is applied while the wave is <em>bipolar</em>, so that the wave's upper and lower halves are affected equally, preserving any vertical symmetry the wave may have.</td></tr>

<a name="Pulse_Width"><h2>Pulse Width</h2></a>

<p>This property only affects pulse <a href="#Waveform">waveforms</a>, and together with <a href="#Slew">Slew</a> it determines the pulse's shape. Also known as <em>duty cycle</em>, Pulse Width is the fraction of the cycle occupied by the pulse, normalized to the range zero to one. If pulse width is zero, the pulse is non-existent. If it's one, the pulse occupies the entire cycle. If it's 0.5, the pulse occupies half the cycle.

<a name="Slew"><h2>Slew</h2></a>

<p>This property only affects pulse <a href="#Waveform">waveforms</a>, and together with <a href="#Pulse_Width">Pulse Width</a> it determines the pulse's shape. For the Pulse and Rounded Pulse waveforms, it sets how quickly the pulse rises and falls. For the Triangular Pulse waveform, it skews the triangle. For the Ramp Pulse waveform, it rotates the ramp. Slew is normalized to the range zero to one.

<p><table border=1 cellpadding=2 cellspacing=0>
<tr><th>Waveform</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr><td>Pulse</td><td>Slew determines the portion of the pulse spent rising and falling. As slew increases, the pulse becomes less rectangular and more beveled. If slew is zero, the pulse is rectangular, because it rises and falls instantaneously. If slew is one, the pulse is an isosceles triangle, because it's entirely rise and fall, with no sustain. Otherwise, the pulse is an isosceles trapezoid. At the default slew of 0.5, the pulse is half rise and fall, and half sustain, i.e. 25% attack, 50% sustain, 25% decay.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Rounded Pulse</td><td>Slew determines the portion of the pulse spent rising and falling, but the rise and fall are curved rather than linear. As slew increases, the pulse becomes less rectangular and more sinusoidal.  The rounded pulse is useful for smoothly fading effects in and out, because it avoids banding artifacts caused by sudden slope changes. If slew is zero, the pulse is rectangular. If slew is one, the pulse is the positive half of a sine wave. Otherwise, the pulse is an isosceles trapezoid, but with sinusoids replacing the beveled sides.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Circular Pulse</td><td>Slew determines the portion of the pulse spent rising and falling, but the rise and fall are circular quadrants rather than linear. As slew increases, the pulse becomes less rectangular and more semicircular. If slew is zero, the pulse is rectangular. If slew is one, the pulse is a semicircle or semiellipse.</td>
</tr><tr><td>Triangular Pulse</td><td>Slew determines how skewed the triangle is. If it's zero, the pulse is a ramp (sawtooth). If it's one, the pulse is also a ramp, but sloping up instead of down. At the default value of 0.5, the pulse is an isosceles triangle. The pulse can be curved via the <a href="#Power">Power</a> property.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Ramp Pulse</td><td>Slew determines how skewed the ramp is. If it's zero, the pulse is a typical ramp. If it's one, the pulse has a lightning bolt shape. At the default value of 0.5, the pulse is a triangle wave. The lightning bolt shape slopes from the center to one rail, and then slopes from the other rail back to the center.</td></tr>

<a name="Secondary_modulation"><h2>Secondary modulation</h2></a>

<p>Each of PotterDraw's <a href="#Properties">properties</a> can be <a href="#Modulation">modulated</a> by an oscillator. Each of these oscillators has its own properties, such as <a href="#Waveform">waveform</a>, <a href="#Frequency">frequency</a>, <a href="#Amplitude">amplitude</a> and so on, and these properties can also be modulated. In other words, you can modulate a modulation. This means there are two levels of modulation in PotterDraw: <em>primary</em> modulation, in which an oscillator directly modulates one of the pot's properties, and <em>secondary</em> modulation, in which an oscillator modulates a property of a primary modulation.

<p>Secondary modulation is an <b>advanced feature</b> that lets you create more complex effects. Its most common applications are amplitude modulation (AM) and frequency modulation (FM). For example you might want to apply a waveform to a property, but only on part of the pot. This is amplitude modulation, and it can be visualized as applying an amplitude <em>envelope</em> to a waveform. For another example, you might want the waveform's frequency to vary over the range of the pot. This is frequency modulation.

<p>Other more esoteric types of modulation are supported, such as <a href="#Pulse_Width">pulse width</a> modulation (PWM), <a href="#Phase">phase</a> modulation, etc. Mutiple-choice (drop list) properties such as waveform or <a href="#Motif">motif</a> can also be modulated, but note that because they're integers they will modulate in discrete steps rather than continuously. Multiple types of secondary modulation can be applied to the same primary modulation, for example you could modulate a primary modulation's amplitude AND its frequency.

<p>Secondary modulations are accessed via the modulation <a href="#Type">type</a> drop list. This setting affects what's shown in both the modulation and <a href="#Oscilloscope">oscilloscope</a> bars. When modulation type is set to "Property", you're accessing the <a href="#Target">target</a> property's primary modulation, but if it's set to any other value, you're accessing a secondary modulation. Note that for a secondary modulation to have any effect, the primary modulation it applies to must be enabled, i.e. its waveform must be set to something other than "None".

<p><b>Example</b>

<p>Suppose you're <a href="#Modulation">modulating</a> the <a href="#Scallop_Depth">Scallop Depth</a> property with a sine wave, so that the scallops undulate as they progress vertically up the pot. Now suppose you also want to vary the intensity of that undulation, so that it's strong at the bottom of the pot, and gradually weakens to nonexistent at the top of the pot. In other words, you want to apply an amplitude <em>envelope</em> to the undulation. More specifically, you want to modulate the amplitude of the Scallop Depth modulation with a descending ramp wave. You could do this as follows:

<ol>
<li>In a new document, set the number of <a href="#Scallops">scallops</a> to 5, and the scallop depth to 10. Also disable <a href="#Texture">Texture</a> so you can see the pot's shape more clearly.
<li>In the modulation bar, make sure the selected <a href="#Target">target</a> is "Scallop Depth". Now set the <a href="#Waveform">waveform</a> to "Sine", and the <a href="#Operation">operation</a> to "Multiply". You should see undulations in your scallops.
<li>Change the modulation <a href="#Type">type</a> from "Property" to "Amplitude". You're now editing a secondary modulation (amplitude modulation), and the Amplitude row is highlighted in red to remind you of this. Notice that the modulation properties and <a href="#Oscilloscope">oscilloscope</a> no longer reflect the edits you made in step 2, because you're no longer accessing the primary modulation.
<li>Change the waveform to "Ramp Down", the operation to "Multiply", and the <a href="#Range">range</a> to "Unipolar". The oscilloscope should show a ramp wave descending from one to zero. A blue triangle appears to the left of the Amplitude row to indicate that amplitude is modulated.
<li>Change the modulation type back to "Property". The edits you made in step 2 reappear, and the oscilloscope and the <a href="#View">view</a> should now show an amplitude-modulated scallop depth modulation.
</ol>


<h1>Oscilloscope</h1>

<a name="Oscilloscope"><h2>Oscilloscope</h2></a>

<p>The oscilloscope helps you to visualize your <a href="#Modulation">modulations</a>. It displays a plot of the currently selected <a href="#Properties">property</a>, including the effect of the property's modulation if any. The plot is continuously updated during <a href="#Animation">animation</a>. The plot's vertical axis corresponds to vertical position on the pot, from bottom to top. The horizontal axis is automatically scaled to fit the range of property values. To show the Oscilloscope bar, use <span class="cmd">View/Toolbars and Docking Windows/Oscilloscope</span>.

<p>The oscilloscope can optionally display all modulated properties at once, so that you can see how your modulations interact with each other. This is particularly useful when animating multiple properties. To enable this feature, set <a href="#Plot_All_Modulations">Plot All Modulations</a> to true in the <a href="#Options">Options</a> dialog. The currently selected property is also shown, even if it isn't modulated. Note that if your modulations cover very different ranges, you may need to zoom or pan the plot to see the smaller ranges clearly; see below.

<p>The oscilloscope window supports zooming (via mouse wheel) and panning (via left-click and drag). To zoom, left-click in the oscilloscope window to ensure it has focus, position the cursor at the desired location, and then spin the mouse wheel to zoom in or out. To pan, left-click in the oscilloscope window and while holding down the left mouse button, move the cursor left or right to scroll the plot.


<h1>Palette</h1>

<a name="Palette"><h2>Palette</h2></a>

<p>The palette lets you choose the colors used for <a href="#Texture_synthesis">texture synthesis</a>. To show the Palette bar, use <span class="cmd">View/Toolbars and Docking Windows/Palette</span>. The palette bar has two components: a color picker on top, and underneath it a color bar, containing a row of square color swatches, one for each color in the palette. Note that if the pot's texture is a <a href="#Texture_Path">user-specified image file</a>, changing the palette has no effect.

<a name="Editing_a_color"><h3>Editing a color</h3></a>

<p>One of the swatches in the color bar has a highlight around it. This highlight indicates which of your palette's colors is displayed and editable in the color picker. To change the selected color, left-click a different color swatch. You can also use the arrow keys to scroll through the color swatches.

<p>To edit a color, first select it the color bar as explained above. Then use the color picker to change its value as desired, and press the Apply button to save your change and update the <a href="#View">view</a>. The color picker has two pages, Standard and Custom, which are explained below.

<a name="Standard_color_picker"><h3>Standard color picker</h3></a>

<p>The Standard color picker limits you to the colors displayed on its hexagonal tiles. If one of these colors is acceptable, simply left-click it and press Apply. Pressing the <span class="key">Enter</span> key is equivalent to pressing Apply. You can also double-click one of the hexagonal tiles, which picks the color and applies the change immediately, in which case there's no need to press the Apply button.

<a name="Custom_color_picker"><h3>Custom color picker</h3></a>

<p>The Custom color picker lets you pick any color, by adjusting the hue/saturation and lightness positions, or by entering numeric HLS or RGB values. The new and current colors are displayed on the right, below the buttons. When the new color is changed as desired, be sure to press Apply to save your change. Pressing the <span class="key">Enter</span> key is equivalent to pressing Apply.

<a name="Palette_editing_commands"><h3>Palette editing commands</h3></a>

<p>The palette can be reordered by dragging the color bar's swatches. You can also <a href="#Copy">copy</a>, <a href="#Cut">cut</a> and <a href="#Paste">paste</a> individual swatches using the standard Windows editing keys <span class="key">Ctrl+C</span>, <span class="key">Ctrl+X</span>, and <span class="key">Ctrl+V</span>, or via the color bar's context menu. Use the Insert key to insert a swatch, or the Delete key to <a href="#Delete">delete</a> a swatch.

<a name="Texture_synthesis"><h2>Texture synthesis</h2></a>

<p>PotterDraw can synthesize a texture to display on the pot, using the colors specified in the <a href="#Palette">palette</a>. The <a href="#Color_Pattern">Color Pattern</a> selects a trigonometric mapping function that determines how the texture is mapped to the pot's surface, e.g. stripes, rings, petals, polar, etc. The mapping functions are affected by various parameters, including <a href="#Color_Cycles">Color Cycles</a>, <a href="#Stripe_Frequency">Stripe Frequency</a>, <a href="#Stripe_Amplitude">Stripe Amplitude</a>, <a href="#Stripe_Phase">Stripe Phase</a>, <a href="#Petals">Petals</a>, <a href="#V_Offset">V Offset</a>, and <a href="#U_Offset">U Offset</a>. The <a href="#Palette_Type">Palette Type</a> determines how the palette colors are used in the texture.

<p>Note that texture synthesis only occurs if the <a href="#Texture_Path">Texture Path</a> property is blank. If Texture Path specifies an image file, the image file is used as the texture, and the palette is ignored.

<p>Use this command to export the active document as a 2D image or a 3D model. The command displays a standard file dialog. Navigate to the desired location, enter a filename if necessary, and use the "Save as type" drop list to select the desired export type. The export types are explained below.

<a name="2D_exports"><h4>2D exports</h4></a>

<p>The 2D exports output an image with the same dimensions as the current <a href="#View">view</a>, unless <a href="#Use_Custom_Image_Size">Use Custom Image Size</a> is set to true in the <a href="#Options">Options</a> dialog. In the latter case the dimensions are specified by <a href="#Custom_Image_Width">Custom Image Width</a> and <a href="#Custom_Image_Height">Custom Image Height</a>, also in the Options dialog, regardless of the view's size. This is useful for exporting images with specific dimensions, or high-resolution images bigger than the view.

<p><table border=1 cellpadding=2 cellspacing=0>
<tr><th>Format</th><th>Comments</th></tr>
<tr><td>BMP</td><td>Outputs a Device-Independent Bitmap file with 24-bit color.</td></tr>
<tr><td>PNG</td><td>Outputs a Portable Network Graphics file with 24-bit color. The resulting file may be significantly smaller than the equivalent bitmap, with no loss of quality.</td></tr>
</table>

<a name="3D_exports"><h4>3D exports</h4></a>

<p>The 3D exports have been tested using MeshLab. If you need a 3D format that PotterDraw doesn't support, it's recommended to export PLY or OBJ and use MeshLab to convert to the desired format.

<p><table border=1 cellpadding=2 cellspacing=0>
<tr><th>Format</th><th>Comments</th></tr>
<tr><td>OBJ</td><td>Outputs a Wavefront OBJ file, along with its corresponding MTL file specifying material properties. This export handles texture mapping. The texture file is automatically copied to the destination folder, and renamed if necessary to avoid spaces in the filename. OBJ is an ASCII format, which is potentially less accurate than a binary format, depending on the numeric precision used. The default precision is six digits after the decimal point, but this can be changed via <a href="#Floating-Point_Precision">Floating-Point Precision</a> in the Options dialog.</td></tr>
<tr><td>PLY</td><td>Outputs a PLY file. This export handles texture mapping. The texture file is automatically copied to the destination folder, and renamed if necessary to avoid spaces in the filename. Not all applications support texture mapping in PLY files, but vertex color is widely supported. To output a PLY with vertex color instead of texture mapping, set <a href="#Use_Vertex_Color">Use Vertex Color</a> to true in the Options dialog. PLY is a binary format, so numeric precision doesn't apply.</td></tr>
<tr><td>STL</td><td>Outputs a binary Stereo Lithography (STL) file. This export doesn't handle texture mapping or color. STL format doesn't support vertex indices, and consequently STL files contain large numbers of duplicate vertices.</td></tr>
</table>

<a name="Record"><h3>Record</h3></a>

<p>Use this command to record a video of an <a href="#Animation">animation</a>. The video is recorded as a series of sequentially-numbered image files, which must be converted to a video using additional software such as ffmpeg or VLC. To start recording, use <span class="cmd">File/Record</span> or the Record button on the main Toolbar.

<p>The Record command first displays a folder dialog. Use the folder dialog to select a destination folder for the image files, and then press OK. Next the Record dialog is displayed. Use the Record dialog to specify the recording's duration (in time or frames), its frame rate in frames per second, its frame size in pixels, the image file format, and whether to automatically start animating and/or <a href="#Auto_Rotate">auto-rotating</a> when recording begins. Press OK to start recording.

<p>During recording, the <a href="#Record_Status">Record Status</a> dialog is displayed, so that you can tell how far along the recording is, and cancel it if necessary. Note that the application's user interface may be sluggish during recording, due to the overhead of creating image files, particularly for large frame sizes.

<p>The usual reason to make a video is to show auto-rotation, animation, or both. If neither of these features is enabled, the recording may be dull. Note that for animation to do anything you must have at least one <a href="#Modulation">modulation</a> with a non-zero <a href="#Phase_Speed">Phase Speed</a>. It's difficult (but not impossible) to manually change the pot's <a href="#Properties">properties</a> during recording, due to the aforementioned sluggishness of the user interface.

<a name="Enable_Animation"><h3>Animation</h3></a>

<p>This command enables or disables <a href="#Animation">animation</a>. For animation to work, at least one mesh or texture <a href="#Properties">property</a> must have a <a href="#Modulation">modulation</a> with a non-zero <a href="#Phase_Speed">Phase Speed</a>.

<a name="Step_Forward"><h3>Step Forward</h3></a>

<p>Use this command to step animated <a href="#Modulation">modulations</a> forward by one frame. Combined with <a href="#Step_Backward">Step Backward</a>, this lets you move to a precise position within an <a href="#Animation">animation</a> by stepping through it one frame at a time. This can be useful for fine-tuning an image or model prior to <a href="#Export">exporting</a> it. The command is only available while the animation is stopped. The shortcut is <span class="key">Ctrl+Space</span>.

<p>Only <em>animated</em> modulations (those with a non-zero <a href="#Phase_Speed">Phase Speed</a>) are affected. The affected <a href="#Properties">properties</a> will have upward-pointing orange triangles to the left of their names in the Properties bar. If no animated modulations exist, the command is disabled.

<a name="Step_Backward"><h3>Step Backward</h3></a>

<p>Use this command to step animated <a href="#Modulation">modulations</a> backward by one frame. Combined with <a href="#Step_Forward">Step Forward</a>, this lets you move to a precise position within an <a href="#Animation">animation</a> by stepping through it one frame at a time. This can be useful for fine-tuning an image or model prior to <a href="#Export">exporting</a> it. The command is only available while the animation is stopped. The shortcut is <span class="key">Ctrl+Shift+Space</span>.

<p>Only <em>animated</em> modulations (those with a non-zero <a href="#Phase_Speed">Phase Speed</a>) are affected.

If no animated modulations exist, the command is disabled.

<a name="Random_Phase"><h3>Random Phase</h3></a>

<p>Use this command to jump to a random position within an <a href="#Animation">animation</a>. The command sets the <a href="#Phase">phase</a> of every animated <a href="#Modulation">modulation</a> to a random value. By using this command repeatedly, you can explore an animation's <em>phase space</em>, i.e. its range of possible states. The animation can be running or stopped. The shortcut is <span class="key">F9</span>.

<p>Only <em>animated</em> modulations (those with a non-zero <a href="#Phase_Speed">Phase Speed</a>) are affected. The affected <a href="#Properties">properties</a> will have green or orange upward-pointing triangles to the left of their names in the Properties bar. If no animated modulations exist, the command is disabled.


<h2>Render</h2>

<a name="Wireframe"><h3>Wireframe</h3></a>

<p>This command enables or disables showing the pot as a wireframe model. The current texture if any remains faintly visible on the wires unless you disable <a href="#Texture">texture</a> mapping. To see all facets, you must also disable <a href="#Culling">culling</a>; doing so will make the wireframe much denser.

<a name="Gouraud"><h3>Gouraud</h3></a>

<p>This command enables or disables Gouraud shading, which interpolates the colors of the pixels within each facet so that the pot's surface appears smooth.

<a name="Highlights"><h3>Highlights</h3></a>

<p>This command enables or disables specular highlights, which make the pot's surface appear shiny, as if the pot were made of a reflective material. For a matte appearance, disable highlights.

<a name="Culling"><h3>Culling</h3></a>

<p>This command enables or disables backface culling, which skips the rendering of completely hidden facets. For optimal performance, culling should normally be enabled. Disabling it has no visible effect unless you're viewing the pot as a <a href="#Wireframe">wireframe</a>.

<a name="Texture"><h3>Texture</h3></a>

<p>This command enables or disables texture mapping. If it's enabled, the current <a href="#Texture_synthesis">synthesized</a> or <a href="#Texture_Path">user-specified</a> texture is shown; if it's disabled, the pot is rendered in shades of grey.

<a name="Transparent"><h3>Transparent</h3></a>

<p>This command enables or disables transparency. To emulate clear glass, disable <a href="#Texture">texture mapping</a>, and enable <a href="#Highlights">highlights</a>. The effect is more realistic when the <a href="#Background_Color">background color</a> is white. It may also help to adjust the <a href="#Lighting">lighting</a>, for example by increasing its angle and specular component. Note that if texture mapping is enabled, the material appears translucent, but the texture's colors are inverted.

<a name="Bounds"><h3>Bounds</h3></a>

<p>This command enables or disables showing an outlined bounding box around the pot. If the bounding box is hard to see, try changing the <a href="#Background_Color">background</a> to a darker color.

<a name="Lighting"><h3>Lighting</h3></a>

<p>This command displays the Lighting dialog, which lets you edit the lighting properties. When you're done editing them, press the OK button to save your changes. The properties are explained below. To restore the default lighting, press the Reset button.

<p><table border=1 cellpadding=2 cellspacing=0>
<tr><th>Property</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr><td>Direction</td><td>This is the direction that the light source is pointing, as a vector in view coordinates. Positive X lights the model's left side, positive Y lights its bottom, and positive Z lights its front, from the user's point of view. Only the vector's direction matters; its length is ignored. The vector needn't be normalized, but at least one of its coordinates must be non-zero. Negative Z causes back-lighting, which is usually unhelpful.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Diffuse</td><td>This value specifies the brightness of the diffuse lighting. It generally ranges from zero to one.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Ambient</td><td>This value specifies the brightness of the ambient lighting. It generally ranges from zero to one. Ambient lighting is unaffected by direction.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Specular</td><td>This value specifies the brightness of the specular lighting. It generally ranges from zero to one. Specular lighting only has an effect if <a href="#Highlights">Highlights</a> are enabled.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Power</td><td>This value specifies the sharpness of specular highlights. The higher the value, the sharper the highlight.</td></tr>
</table>


<h2>Spline</h2>

<a name="Add_Node"><h3>Add Node</h3></a>

<p>This command adds a node to the <a href="#Spline">spline</a> at the cursor position.

<a name="Delete_Node"><h3>Delete Node</h3></a>

<p>This command deletes a node from the <a href="#Spline">spline</a> at the cursor position.

<a name="Translate"><h3>Translate</h3></a>

<p>This command translates (moves) the selected segments of the <a href="#Spline">spline</a>. The Translate dialog prompts you for the translation amount in both axes. This is useful if you want to specify a translation numerically, instead of via dragging.

<a name="Scale"><h3>Scale</h3></a>

<p>This command scales the selected segments of the <a href="#Spline">spline</a>. The scaling can be proportional (isotropic) or non-proportional (anisotropic). The Scale dialog prompts you for the scaling percentage, or in the non-proportional case, for the width and height percentages. You can also specify whether the scaling should be relative to the origin, or relative to the center of the selection.

<a name="Rotate"><h3>Rotate</h3></a>

<p>This command rotates the selected segments of the <a href="#Spline">spline</a>. The Rotate dialog prompts you for the rotation in degrees. You can also specify whether the rotation should be relative to the origin, or relative to the center of the selection.

<a name="Flip_Horizontal"><h3>Flip Horizontal</h3></a>

<p>This command horizontally flips the selected segments of the <a href="#Spline">spline</a>. When combined with <a href="#Copy">Copy</a> and <a href="#Paste">Paste</a>, this can be useful for creating symmetrical shapes.

<a name="Flip_Vertical"><h3>Flip Vertical</h3></a>

<p>This command vertically flips the selected segments of the <a href="#Spline">spline</a>. When combined with <a href="#Copy">Copy</a> and <a href="#Paste">Paste</a>, this can be useful for creating symmetrical shapes.

<p>This command shows or hides the <a href="#Grid_and_rulers">grid</a> in the <a href="#Spline">spline</a> window. To change the grid spacing, use the <a href="#Grid_Setup">Grid Setup</a> command.

<a name="Snap_to_Grid"><h3>Snap to Grid</h3></a>

<p>This command enables or disables snapping to the <a href="#Grid_and_rulers">grid</a> in the <a href="#Spline">spline</a> window. To change the grid spacing, use the <a href="#Grid_Setup">Grid Setup</a> command.

<a name="Show_Rulers"><h3>Show Rulers</h3></a>

<p>This command shows or hides the <a href="#Grid_and_rulers">rulers</a> in the <a href="#Spline">spline</a> window.

<a name="Opposite_Wall"><h3>Opposite Wall</h3></a>

<p>This command enables or disables horizontal mirroring in the <a href="#Spline">spline</a> window. Mirroring shows you what the opposite wall of the pot will look like at all times. This is useful because it provides immediate visual feedback during spline <a href="#Dragging_segments_and_nodes">dragging</a>, unlike the <a href="#View">view</a> which normally only updates when spline dragging is complete. You can configure PotterDraw to continuously update the view during spline dragging, by setting the <a href="#Show_Spline_Drag_in_View">Show Spline Drag in View</a> option to true, but note that doing so may degrade performance.

<a name="Grid_Setup"><h3>Grid Setup</h3></a>

<p>This command lets you change the spacing of the <a href="#Spline">spline</a> window's grid.

<a name="Import_Spline"><h3>Import</h3></a>

<a name="Segment_Type"><h3>Segment Type</h3></a>

<p>This submenu lets you change the type of selected <a href="#Segments_and_nodes">segments</a> in the <a href="#Spline">spline</a> window.

<a name="Zoom"><h3>Zoom</h3></a>

<p>This submenu lets you zoom in, zoom out, or reset zoom and panning in the <a href="#Spline">spline</a> window. You can also use the shortcuts <span class="key">Ctrl+=</span> and <span class="key">Ctrl+-</span>, and <span class="key">Ctrl+0</span>.


<h2>Tools</h2>

<a name="Options"><h3>Options</h3></a>

<p>This command displays a dialog that lets you edit PotterDraw's options, which are global user preferences that apply to all documents. The options are summarized <a href="#Options_Summary">here</a>. Press OK to close and save your changes, or Cancel to close without saving. To reset all options to their default values, press the Reset All button.

<a name="Mesh_Information"><h3>Mesh Information</h3></a>

<p>This command displays information about the current mesh, including its vertex count, facet count, and bounds. The command also checks your <a href="#Spline">spline</a> for <a href="#Shape_limitations">conformance</a> and warns you if problems are detected.

<a name="Import_Palette"><h3>Import Palette</h3></a>

<p>This command imports a palette from a file. The file must be plain text. Each line is expected to contain an RGB color value, consisting of three decimal numbers, separated by tabs or spaces. These numbers are the color's red, green, and blue values, and they should be in the range 0 to 255. Any other information in the file is ignored. The palette size is inferred from the number of colors found in the file.

<p>Note that large palettes may cause the error message "Texture is too wide." To avoid this error, try reducing <a href="#Color_Sharpness">Color Sharpness</a> to ten or less. The issue is that during <a href="#Texture_synthesis">texture synthesis</a>, the texture width is determined by multiplying the palette's number of colors by Color Sharpness. Texture width is typically limited to 8,192 pixels, though the actual limit is platform-dependent.

<a name="Export_Palette"><h3>Export Palette</h3></a>

<p>This command exports the current palette to a file. The file is plain text, containing one RGB color value per line. Each color value consists of three tab-separated decimal numbers. For more information, see the <a href="#Import_Palette">Import Palette</a> command.


<h2>Window</h2>

<a name="New_Window"><h3>New Window</h3></a>

<p>Use this command to open a new window with the same contents as the active window. You can open multiple document windows to display different parts or views of a document at the same time. If you change the contents in one window, all other windows containing the same document reflect those changes. When you open a new window, it becomes the active window and is displayed on top of all other open windows.

<a name="Cascade"><h3>Cascade</h3></a>

<p>Use this command to arrange multiple opened windows in an overlapped fashion. Note that this command isn't supported for <a href="#Tabs">tabbed MDI</a>.

<a name="Arrange_Icons"><h3>Arrange Icons</h3></a>

<p>Use this command to arrange the icons for minimized windows at the bottom of the main window. If there is an open document window at the bottom of the main window, then some or all of the icons may not be visible because they will be underneath this document window. Note that this command isn't supported for <a href="#Tabs">tabbed MDI</a>.

<a name="Full_Screen"><h3>Full Screen</h3></a>

<p>Use this command to toggle full screen mode. In full screen mode, the <a href="#View">view</a> is enlarged to fill the entire monitor, and all other application windows are hidden, including the menus and caption bar. The <a href="#Shortcuts">shortcut keys</a> still work however.

<p>To enter full screen mode, use <span class="cmd">Window/Full Screen</span> or press <span class="key">F11</span>. To exit full screen mode, press <span class="key">F11</span> or the Escape key.

<p>This is the amount by which the <a href="#Pan">panning</a> commands pan the <a href="#View">view</a>, in view coordinates. Increase it to make panning faster but coarser; decrease it to make panning slower but more precise.

<a name="Drag_Rotate_Step"><h2>Drag Rotate Step</h2></a>

<p>In the <a href="#View">view</a>, the pot can be rolled (rotated around the z-axis) by left-clicking and dragging horizontally while pressing and holding down the <span class="key">Shift</span> key. This value sets how sensitive the roll behavior is, in degrees of z-axis rotation per pixel of horizontal cursor motion. Increase it to make rolling faster but coarser; decrease it to make rolling slower but more precise.

<a name="Use_Vertex_Color"><h2>Use Vertex Color</h2></a>

<p>If this is true, <a href="#3D_exports">3D exports</a> use vertex color instead of texture mapping. Currently only the PLY export respects this setting. Texture mapping usually gives superior results, particularly if the texture contains fine detail or sharp edges. However if you're exporting to a 3D software that doesn't support texture mapping, vertex color may be a useful alternative.

<p>The color at each vertex is computed by linearly interpolating the colors of the texture's nearest pixels. This works well for soft color gradations, but for sharp edges, it tends to produce artifacts such as stairstepping. Increasing the number of facets in the model (by increasing <a href="#Rings">rings</a> and <a href="#Sides">sides</a>) may lessen the artifacts, but at the cost of increased file size.

<a name="Use_Custom_Image_Size"><h2>Use Custom Image Size</h2></a>

<p>This controls how <a href="#2D_exports">2D exports</a> determine the size of exported images. If this option is false, exported images have the same dimensions as the <a href="#View">view</a> (the default behavior). If this option is true, the dimensions come from the <a href="#Custom_Image_Width">custom image width</a> and <a href="#Custom_Image_Height">height</a> instead. If you want to export 2D images of a particular size, set this option true and use the width and height to specify the size in pixels. For optimal quality, export your images at the intended size rather than resizing them afterwards with an image editor.

<a name="Custom_Image_Width"><h2>Custom Image Width</h2></a>

<p>If <a href="#Use_Custom_Image_Size">Use Custom Image Size</a> is true, <a href="#2D_exports">exported</a> 2D images have this width in pixels, otherwise they have the same width as the <a href="#View">view</a>.

<a name="Custom_Image_Height"><h2>Custom Image Height</h2></a>

<p>If <a href="#Use_Custom_Image_Size">Use Custom Image Size</a> is true, <a href="#2D_exports">exported</a> 2D images have this height in pixels, otherwise they have the same height as the <a href="#View">view</a>.

<a name="Floating-Point_Precision"><h2>Floating-Point Precision</h2></a>

<p>This is the number of digits after the decimal point for <a href="#3D_exports">3D exports</a> that store values as ASCII text, as opposed to binary. Currently only the Wavefront OBJ export respects this setting. More digits will make the exported model more precise, but at the cost of increased file size. At the upper limit (17 digits), text exports are as precise as binary exports.

<a name="Plot_All_Modulations"><h2>Plot All Modulations</h2></a>

<p>This affects which <a href="#Properties">properties</a> are plotted in the <a href="#Oscilloscope">oscilloscope</a> window. If this option is false, the oscilloscope plots only one property at a time: the current modulation <a href="#Target">target</a>. If this option is true, the oscilloscope plots all <a href="#Modulation">modulated</a> properties at once, which lets you see how they interact with each other.

<a name="Spline_Zoom_Step"><h2>Spline Zoom Step</h2></a>

<p>This is the percentage by which the <a href="#Spline">spline</a> window zooms for each step of the mouse wheel. The <a href="#Zoom_In">zoom in</a> and <a href="#Zoom_Out">zoom out</a> commands and their shortcuts also use this step size when the spline window has focus. Increase it to make zooming faster but coarser; decrease it to make zooming slower but more precise. Note that the <a href="#View">view</a> has its own independent <a href="#Zoom_Step">Zoom Step</a>.

<a name="Show_Spline_Drag_in_View"><h2>Show Spline Drag in View</h2></a>

<p>This determines how the <a href="#View">view</a> responds to <a href="#Dragging_segments_and_nodes">dragging segments and nodes</a> in the <a href="#Spline">spline</a> window. If this option is false, the view isn't updated until dragging is complete, i.e. until the left mouse button is released. If this option is true, the view is updated continuously while the spline is being dragged. This option is false by default, because view updates are potentially time-consuming and doing them frequently can degrade performance.

<p>Continuously updating the view gives useful feedback and makes the spline editor more intuitive and fun to use, but it can also make the user interface sluggish, jerky or unresponsive, particularly if the pot has a large number of facets (<a href="#Rings">rings</a> and <a href="#Sides">sides</a>) or a large <a href="#Texture">texture</a>. As a safer alternative, the spline editor can show the pot's <a href="#Opposite_Wall">opposite wall</a>, which is always updated continuously during dragging and doesn't impact performance.

<a name="Show_Property_Descriptions"><h2>Show Property Descriptions</h2></a>

<p>This option determines whether a description pane is shown at the bottom of property bars, including the <a href="#Properties">properties</a>, <a href="#Modulation">modulation</a>, and <a href="#Options">options</a> bars. If you don't need the descriptions, you can make room for more properties by setting this option false.

<a name="Automatically_check_for_updates"><h2>Automatically check for updates</h2></a>

<p>This option determines whether PotterDraw automatically checks for updates when it launches. If a newer version is available, you will be prompted with the message "A newer version of PotterDraw is available. Do you want to download and install it?" The options are as follows:

<p><table border=1 cellpadding=2 cellspacing=0>
<tr><td>Yes</td><td>Download and install</td><td>The newer version is downloaded and installed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>No</td><td>Skip this version</td><td>The newer version is NOT downloaded, and no further notifications are given <em>for this version</em>, though you'll continue to be notified of subsequent versions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Later</td><td>Defer the update</td><td>The newer version is NOT downloaded, but you'll be notified about it again the next time you launch PotterDraw.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>To disable automatically checking for updates, uncheck this option. Note that automatic checking costs you nothing in terms of performance, because it's done from a worker thread. Regardless of whether automatic checking is enabled, you can always manually check for a newer version via <a href="#Check_for_Updates">Check for Updates</a>.

<p>PotterDraw must exit before it can be reinstalled. The update procedure attempts to close PotterDraw, however if there's an unsaved document, the update stalls until you respond to the "Save changes" dialog. In this case a console window will be visible, repeatedly displaying the message "Waiting for PotterDraw to exit...".

<p>If reinstallation fails with a permissions-related error it's most likely because you're not logged on as Administrator.


<h1>Reference</h1>

<a name="Normalized_angle"><h2>Normalized angle</h2></a>

<p>In PotterDraw all phase-related <a href="#Properties">properties</a> are expressed as <em>normalized angles</em>. A normalized angle maps the full range of angles (360 degrees) to the range zero to one. The following table shows the relationship between normalized angles and degrees:

<p><table border=1 cellpadding=2 cellspacing=0>
<tr><th>Normalized</th><th>Degrees</th></tr>
<tr><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr>
<tr><td>0.25</td><td>90</td></tr>
<tr><td>0.5</td><td>180</td></tr>
<tr><td>0.75</td><td>270</td></tr>
<tr><td>1</td><td>360</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Values outside the range [0..1] wrap around, e.g. 1.25 wraps to 90&deg; and &minus;0.25 wraps to 270&deg;.
