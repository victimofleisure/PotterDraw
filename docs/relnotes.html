<h1>Release Notes</h1>

<h3>1.0.08.000 &emsp;<small>05/21/2021</small></h3>
<ol>
<li>Generated palette swaps red and blue channels in Windows 10; fixed.
</ol>

<h3>1.0.07.001 &emsp;<small>03/05/2018</small></h3>
<ol>
<li>Secondary modulation was added, allowing modulations to be modulated; types include amplitude modulation (AM), frequency modulation (FM), pulse width modulation, etc.
<li>The Semicircle and Circular Pulse waveforms were added.
<li>The Invert motif was added.
<li>Vertex rotation was optimized, increasing render speed by ~4% and improving precision.
<li>Editing a drop list in the Modulation bar via left-click didn't update the toolbar's undo/redo icons until the focus was changed; fixed.
</ol>

<h3>1.0.06.002 &emsp;<small>01/20/2018</small></h3>

<ol>
<li>A Ring Phase property was added, to allow more complex twisting effects.
<li>A Ruffle oscillator was added to the Bend effect; it phase modulates the Bend oscillator to create wavy ripples.
<li>Optional auto-zoom was added to the auto-rotate effect.
</ol>

<h3>1.0.05.000 &emsp;<small>12/23/2017</small></h3>

<ol>
<li>Four new color patterns were added: Azimuth, Incline, Azimuth & Incline, and Edges.
<li>For Ripple and Bend, Operation, Power, and Power Type and properties were added.
<li>Transparency is now supported, via the Transparent render style (Render/Transparent).
<li>The render style (Wireframe, Gouraud, etc.) and Lighting commands were moved from the View menu to the new Render menu.
<li>Step Forward and Step Backward commands were added to the View menu. They let you move to a precise position within an animation by stepping one frame at a time.
<li>The Random Phase command was added to the View menu. It lets you explore an animation's phase space, by randomizing the phases of animated modulations.
<li>In previous versions, a non-animated modulation of a mesh property would slow texture-only animation, by causing the mesh to be needlessly rebuilt for every frame; fixed.
</ol>

<h3>1.0.04.000 &emsp;<small>11/21/2017</small></h3>

<ol>
<li>Polygonal shapes are now supported, via a new group of polygon mesh properties.
<li>The radius color pattern was added; it uses the pot's radius as the U coordinate, so that the texture mapping illustrates the pot's contours.
<li>Exponential power can now be applied to waveforms asymmetrically or symmetrically, selectable via the new Power Type property.
<li>The mesh properties are now organized into subgroups that can be hidden.
<li>The 3D view's lighting is now configurable, via the Lighting command on the View menu.
<li>The palette can now be imported from or exported to a file, via Tools menu commands.
<li>The PLY export with vertex color wasn't handling texture from an image file; fixed.
<li>Texture updates are 16x faster, due to eliminating an unintended video memory read.
<li>Some scallop properties were needlessly rebuilding the mesh in certain cases; fixed.
</ol>

<h3>1.0.03.001 &emsp;<small>10/26/2017</small></h3>

<ol>
<li>New scallop properties were added: Scallop Waveform, Operation, Range, and Power.
<li>New waveforms were added: Pulse, Rounded Pulse, Triangular Pulse, Sine Cubed, and Flame. The new pulse waveforms have variable Pulse Width and Slew.
<li>Recording now saves and restores the pre-record state of the auto-rotate and animation settings.
<li>The record status dialog now includes an estimate of the remaining render time.
<li>In the spline window, adding a node to a line segment unexpectedly produces curves; fixed.
<li>The spline window's grid spacing wasn't being saved in the document; fixed.
</ol>

<h3>1.0.02.000 &emsp;<small>09/07/2017</small></h3>

<ol>
<li>Add Scallop Phase property; modulating it produces wavy scallops.
<li>Add Load Texture command to File menu, so it's more obvious how to load texture.
<li>Allow texture file to be loaded via drag and drop from Explorer.
<li>Add check for updates feature.
<li>Optimize texture mapping, by copying texture from outer to inner wall.
<li>Add option to continuously update view during spline dragging.
<li>Modulation property change wasn't updating oscilloscope, fixed.
</ol>

<h3>1.0.00.001 &emsp;<small>08/16/2017</small></h3>

<p>This is the initial release.
